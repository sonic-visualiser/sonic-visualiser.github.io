      <h4 id="firstpara">What's new in Sonic Visualiser 3.0?</h4>

      <a href="screenshots.html"><img src="images/sv-3.0-win-thumb.png" alt="Sonic Visualiser screen shot" border=0 style="float:right;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:2em;padding-left:2em;max-width:35%"/></a>

      <p>As of the release of version 3.0 in March 2017, Sonic
      Visualiser has been continuously developed and maintained in the
      Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary, University of London for
      about a decade.</p>

      <p>This release is one of the most substantial updates the
      application has ever had. In addition to several new features,
      it includes a number of technical changes to core functions that
      we hope should enable us to maintain a modern and useful
      application in the years to come.</p>

      <h5>Some new features you might like:</h5>

      <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom:0.5em"><b>Audio recording.</b> As well as working with local and
        online audio files, you can now record from the microphone or
        other audio inputs directly into Sonic Visualiser. The choice
        of audio device for both recording and playback can be changed
        in the Preferences.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom:0.5em"><b>Retina and Hi-DPI
        support.</b> Previous versions had only limited support for
        retina or other very high-resolution displays. This release
        provides complete retina-resolution layer rendering on the
        Mac, and proper scaling and display of UI elements with
        high-resolution displays on other platforms.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom:0.5em"><b>SVG export.</b> You can now
        export layers in the scalable SVG image format as well as
        PNG.</li>

        <li style="margin-bottom:0.5em"><b>Improved support for very
        long audio files.</b> Sonic Visualiser can now handle files
        longer than 2<sup>32</sup> sample frames. This applies to
        64-bit builds only, but for the first time ever, the default
        build for Windows is a 64-bit one (other platforms had 64-bit
        builds already in previous releases).
        
        <li><b>New colour scales and
        normalisations</b>, with new colour scale default settings in
        the Preferences.</li>
        
      </ul>

      <p>Behind the scenes there has been a major overhaul in many
      areas of rendering, plugin transform, and audio and file
      handling code.  This release is also substantially more robust
      in its handling of <a href="http://vamp-plugins.org/">Vamp audio
      analysis plugins</a> than previous versions. It should (we
      hope!) now be impossible for an incompatible or crashing Vamp
      plugin to crash Sonic Visualiser with it. Also, the 64-bit
      Windows build is now able to load both 32-bit and 64-bit
      plugins, making it compatible with all the existing 32-bit Vamp
      plugins available for download.</p>
      
      <p>There are a few more features and various bug fixes in this
      release as well, which you can find listed in
      the <a href="https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/sonic-visualiser/repository/revisions/sv_v3.0/entry/CHANGELOG">CHANGELOG</a>
        file.</p>

      <h5>What's not new...</h5>

      <p>Survey feedback has shown that an easier way to obtain and
      install plugins would be very welcome, and we had hoped to have
      something new to offer in that area for this release. Sadly we
        haven't been able to do that yet &mdash; but soon, we hope!</p>
