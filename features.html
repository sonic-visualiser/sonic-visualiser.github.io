      <h2 id="firstpara">Features and Design Goals</h2>
      <p>Sonic Visualiser contains features for the following:
      <ul>

	<li>Load audio files in WAV, Ogg and MP3 formats, and view
	their waveforms.</li>
	
	<li>Look at audio visualisations such as spectrogram views, with
	  interactive adjustment of display parameters.</li>
	
	<li>Annotate audio data by adding labelled time points and defining
	  segments, point values and curves.</li>
	
	<li>Overlay annotations on top of one another with aligned
	scales, and overlay annotations on top of waveform or
	spectrogram views.</li>

	<li>View the same data at multiple time resolutions
	simultaneously (for close-up and overview).</li>

	<li>Run feature-extraction plugins to calculate annotations
	  automatically, using algorithms such as beat trackers, pitch
	  detectors and so on.</li>
	
	<li>Import annotation layers from various text file formats.</li>
	
	<li>Import note data from MIDI files, view it alongside other
	frequency scales, and play it with the original audio.</li>
	
	<li>Play back the audio plus synthesised annotations, taking
	  care to synchronise playback with display.</li>

        <li>Select areas of interest, optionally snapping to nearby
        feature locations, and audition individual and comparative
        selections in seamless loops.</li>
	
	<li>Time-stretch playback, slowing right down or speeding up
	to a tiny fraction or huge multiple of the original speed
	while retaining a synchronised display.</li>
	
	<li>Export audio regions and annotation layers to external files.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The design goals for Sonic Visualiser are:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>To provide the best available core
      waveform and spectrogram audio visualisations for use with
      substantial files of music audio data.</li>

      <li>To facilitate ready comparisons between different kinds of
      data, for example by making it easy to overlay one set of data
      on another, or display the same data in more than one way at the
      same time.</li>

      <li>To be straightforward.  The user interface should be simpler
      to learn and to explain than the internal data structures.  In
      this respect, Sonic Visualiser aims to resemble a consumer
      audio application.</li>

      <li>To be responsive, slick, and enjoyable.  Even if you have to
      wait for your results to be calculated, you should be able to do
      something else with the audio data while you wait.  Sonic
      Visualiser is pervasively multithreaded, loves multiprocessor
      and multicore systems, and can make good use of fast processors
      with plenty of memory.</li>

      <li>To handle large data sets.  The work Sonic Visualiser does
      is intrinsically processor-hungry and (often) memory-hungry, but
      the aim is to allow you to work with long audio files on
      machines with modest CPU and memory where reasonable.  (Disk
      space is another matter.  Sonic Visualiser eats that.)</li>

      </ul>
