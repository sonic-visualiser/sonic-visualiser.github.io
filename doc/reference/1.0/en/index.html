<p>Sonic Visualiser is an application for viewing and analysing the
contents of music audio files.  This is a brief reference manual
explaining the concepts used in Sonic Visualiser and how to use it.
This manual describes Sonic Visualiser version 1.0.</p>

<a name="panesandlayers"></a><h2>1. &nbsp;Panes and Layers</h2>

<a name="paneconcepts"></a><h3>1.1. &nbsp;What are Panes and Layers?</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser's user interface is structured around <i>panes</i>
and <i>layers</i>.  A pane is a horizontally scrollable area of window
like a drawing canvas; a layer is one of a set of things that can be
shown on a pane, such as a waveform, a line graph of measurements,
or a subdivision of the horizontal axis into differently coloured segments.</p>

<p>You can stack as many panes above one another vertically as will fit
 on the screen.  The horizontal axis of each pane corresponds to time
 in audio sample frames, and all of the stacked panes will be aligned
 to the same sample frame at their centre points.</p>

<p>Each pane can then display any number of layers, which are
conceptually stacked on top of one another like layers in a graphics
application.  So for example, you may have a spectrogram layer "at the
back", with measurements, onset positions and notes displayed in
separate layers "in front", i.e. drawn over the top of it.  There are
several different kinds of layer, which differ in the types of data
they can represent: instants, curves (time-value plots), and so
on.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img style="max-width:100%" src="images/pane-layers.png"/><br><i>A pane with four layers: <a href="#waveform">waveform</a> in black, <a href="#timeruler">time ruler</a> in grey, <a href="#timevalues">time values</a> in purple and <a href="#timeinstants">time instants</a> in blue.</i></div></p>

<p>Layers that are stacked on the same pane will always share the same
 magnification and alignment on the x (time) axis.  However, they do
 not have to have identical scales on the y axis &ndash; although Sonic Visualiser will
 attempt to align them by default if their scale units match.</p>

<p style="clear:left"><img style="float:left;padding-top:0.3em;max-width:50%;padding-right:1em" src="images/active.png"/>

One pane is always the "active" pane, and this one is marked with a
 black vertical bar to its left.  The front layer on that pane is the
 active layer.  Any menu operation in Sonic Visualiser that works on a single layer
 will always operate on the active layer.</p>

<p>While most
 of the annotation layer types are interactively editable on the pane
 itself, layers corresponding directly to audio data (such as waveform
 and spectrogram layers) are not.</p>

<a name="paneadding"></a><h3>1.2. &nbsp;Adding Panes and Layers</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser starts with a single visible pane.  When you
import an audio file, it adds <a href="#timeruler">time ruler</a> and
<a href="#waveform">waveform</a> layers to that pane, displaying the
new audio file.

<p>There are then three menus dedicated to adding new panes and layers
to the display, with various kinds of data in them:</p>

<ul>

<li>The Pane menu contains several functions to add new panes
displaying audio data.<br>Use the Add Waveform and Add Spectrum
functions to add a new pane containing a <a
href="#waveform">waveform</a> or <a href="#spectrum">spectrum</a>
layer.  Use one of the three Add Spectrogram functions to add a pane
with a <a href="#spectrogram">spectrogram</a> layer with a particular
set of <a href="#defaultspectrograms">initial properties</a>. You can
also add an empty pane and add layers to it afterwards.</li><p>

<li>The Layer menu contains the same functions as the Pane menu.  When
invoked from the Layer menu, they add a new layer to the current pane
instead of adding a whole new pane.<br>The Layer menu also contains
functions to add empty layers of each of the editable layer types: <a
href="#timeinstants">time instants</a>, <a href="#timevalues">time
values</a>, <a href="#notes">notes</a>, and <a href="#text">text</a>.<br>You can also add an existing layer to another pane, thus displaying
the same thing more than once, or add a <a href="#slice">slice</a> of
an existing <a href="#colour3dplot">colour 3D plot</a> layer.</li><p>

<li>The <a href="#transform">Transform menu</a> lists things you can do
to your audio in order to produce new layers with data in them.
Transforms include applying audio effects plugins to produce different
audio data, and applying feature extraction plugins to extract other
kinds of data from the audio.  See <a href="#plugins">Transforms and
Plugins</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can also add a new layer by <a
href="#layerimport">importing</a> an existing set of annotation data from a file.

<a name="layeredits"></a><h3>1.3. &nbsp;Display Properties</h3>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em" src="images/params-spectrogram.png"/>Each layer, whether editable or not, has a set of adjustable
display properties.  These are shown in a corresponding stack to the
right of the pane.  To save space, not all of the names of the
properties are shown; you can hold the mouse pointer over a control to
see the name of its property in a tooltip.</p>

<p>Click on the numbered tab for a layer in this stack to "raise" that
layer to the front of the pane and adjust its properties.  The available
properties for the different layer types are discussed in the sections
about those layers, below.</p>

<p><img style="float:left;max-width:50%;padding-right:1em" src="images/params-pane.png"/>There is also a tab corresponding to the pane itself, which can
be used to control the way the pane tracks during playback and its
alignment with other panes.</p><p>The Global Scroll and Global Zoom settings (both on by default) make the pane follow any horizontal scrolling and zooming that happens in other panes that also have these settings on, so that when you scroll or zoom in one of them, they all scroll or zoom.</p><p>The Follow Playback control allows you to choose whether the pane will track playback using a playback cursor, paging when it reaches the edge of the pane (Page); or whether it will scroll along with the playback (Scroll); or neither.</p>

<a name="sessionsandundo"></a><h2 style="clear:both">2. &nbsp;Sessions and Undo</h2>

<p>A Sonic Visualiser "session" is a record of almost everything you see
 in front of you in the Sonic Visualiser window: the current layout of panes, the set
 of layers on each one, all of the data in each of the editable layers,
 a reference to the source data (for example the audio file) for
 non-editable layers like waveforms, the display properties for each
 layer, and some information about where each layer came from (for
 example, whether it was generated by a plugin and if so, which plugin
 and how it was configured.)</p>

<p>You can save the entire session to a <code>.sv</code> session file using File -&gt;
 Save Session As...  Reloading this file should restore your session
 state, provided that the original audio file can also be found.  (If
 you are passing session files to other Sonic Visualiser users, be sure to make sure
 they have the audio data as well, as this is never stored in the
 session file.)</p>

<p>Sonic Visualiser provides full multi-level Undo and Redo.  Almost all actions that
 change the session you see in front of you &ndash; with the exception of
 scrolling and zooming &ndash; can be undone.  This includes adding and
 removing layers and panes and changing the display properties for a
 layer, as well as more conventional edits.</p>

<a name="tools"></a><h2>3. &nbsp;Tools</h2>

<p>Sonic Visualiser has four "tools", which control the way mouse actions interact with
 the panes.  These can be activated using the four tool icons on the toolbar:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="images/icons/navigate.png"/> Navigate tool. Used for basic viewing and navigating.  With
  this tool active, you can just click and drag anywhere on a pane
  to move the view of the audio data around.  This tool is active by
  default, except when a new empty editable layer has just been added, when the draw tool (below) is made active.

</li><p><li><img src="images/icons/select.png"/> Select tool. Used for selecting areas.
  Click and drag in any pane to select a region in time.  See also
  <a href="#selection">Selection</a>, below.

</li><p><li><img src="images/icons/move.png"/> Edit tool. Used for moving items in editable layers.

</li><p><li><img src="images/icons/draw.png"/> Draw tool. Used for adding items to editable layers.
</ul>
<a name="selection"></a><h2>4. &nbsp;Selection</h2>

<p>With the select tool <img src="images/icons/select.png"/> active, click and drag
 within any pane to select a region.</p>

<p>The selection boundaries will snap to the resolution or features
 present on the active layer.  For example, if you drag a selection on
 a spectrogram layer, the selection's boundaries will be aligned with
 the spectrogram's FFT window hops; if you drag a selection on a
 time-instants layer, its boundaries will snap to instants present on
 the layer; if you drag a selection on a waveform layer, its boundaries
 will simply snap to audio sample frames.</p>

<p>Pressing Shift as you start dragging a selection will defeat this snap
 effect, forcing the selection to snap to the nearest audio sample to
 each pixel boundary.</p>

<p>You can select more than one separate region at a time, by holding
 Ctrl as you start selecting the second and subsequent regions to add
 them to the existing selection.</p>

<p>You can also click-drag the left and right edges of a selection to
 change its extents after it has been made.</p>

<p>A selection within Sonic Visualiser conceptually consists of one or more regions in
 time.  When you select a region in a layer, you are selecting a period
 of time across all layers; you are not selecting the visible items
 that happen to fall within that region in that one layer.</p>

<p>This has several consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>If more than one item occurs at the same time in the same layer,
  there is no way to select only some of them.

</li><p><li>Even if items in a layer are above or below the visible range of the
  layer's vertical scale (i.e. off the top or bottom of the pane),
  they will still be selected if they fall within a selected time region.

</li><p><li>If you make a selection in one layer and
  then make a different layer active before carrying out an editing
  action that operates on the active layer, it will operate on the new
  active layer &ndash; not on the items in the layer you originally made
  the selection in.
</ul>
<p>An advantage of this is that it is very easy to select all the items
 in one layer that fall between certain items in another layer &ndash; make
 the second layer active, make a selection (which will snap to the item
 positions on that layer), then make the first layer active again.</p>

<a name="editing"></a><h2>5. &nbsp;Editing</h2>

<p>Most of Sonic Visualiser's annotation layer types are interactively editable.
 Layers corresponding directly to audio data (such as waveform
 and spectrogram layers) are not editable.  Sonic Visualiser is not an audio editor.</p>

<p>To move an individual item in a layer, make sure the
 edit tool <img src="images/icons/move.png"/> is active and then click on and drag
 the item.  If the item is relatively wide on the screen, you may have
 to click and drag its left hand edge for the drag to take effect.</p>

<p>You can also edit the details of an item directly, by double-clicking
 on it with either the navigate <img src="images/icons/navigate.png"/> or edit <img src="images/icons/move.png"/> tool selected.  (The advantage
 of using the navigate tool is that it removes the risk of
 accidentally editing the point while double-clicking on it.)</p>

<p>To move a set of items at once, <a href="#selection">select</a> the region around them, then switch to the edit tool <img src="images/icons/move.png"/> and drag the selected
 region.</p>

<p>To delete one or more items, <a href="#selection">select</a> the region around them, then use Edit -> Delete Selected Items.

<a name="cutandpaste"></a><h3>5.1. &nbsp;Cut and Paste</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser allows you to cut and paste between layers of different types,
 preserving as much information as can be reconciled with the layer
 types.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em;padding-bottom:1em" src="images/paste-options.png"/>To cut and paste between two layers, <a href="#selection">select</a> the items in the source
 layer, use Edit -&gt; Cut, select the target layer and Edit -&gt; Paste.
 The items will be pasted at the same location in time as they were
 found in the source layer.</p>

<p>If the target layer is of a type that represents less information
than the source &ndash; for example if you are pasting to a time
instant layer from a time/value curve &ndash; then the relevant
information (in this case time positions) will be retained, and the
rest discarded.</p>

<p>
If the target layer represents more information than the source,
you will be offered various options for how to make up the values that
are not present in the pasted items (as shown to the right).

<a name="layerdetails"></a><h2 style="clear:right">6. &nbsp;The Layers in Detail</h2>

<a name="waveform"></a><h3>6.1. &nbsp;Waveform</h3>

<p>The waveform layer shows audio data in a traditional waveform peak
 display.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img style="max-width:100%" src="images/pane-waveform.png"/><br><i>A waveform layer.</i></div></p>

<p>Each pixel on the horizontal axis shows the peak and mean positive and
 negative values found in samples falling within that pixel's range at
 the current zoom level.  The zoom level can be increased or decreased
 in multiples of sqrt(2) using the mouse wheel or the Up and Down
 cursor keys.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em" src="images/params-waveform.png"/></p>

<p>The Y axis scale can be adjusted using the Scale display properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear (the default): The scale displacement is proportional to the voltage level
  of the resulting audio output.

</li><p><li>dB: The scale displacement is proportional to the log of the
  absolute voltage.

</li><p><li>Meter: An intermediate scale is used that may be non-linear, intended to make peaks more apparent than the dB scale but quiet sections easier to see than the linear scale.
</ul>
<p>The Scale properties also provide a display gain control, and a
 "Normalize Visible Area" switch which will adjust the display gain
 continuously so as to ensure full scale displacement for the largest
 value in the visible section of the waveform.</p>

<p>The way the waveform layer handles multiple channels can be adjusted
 using the Channels display property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate (the default): Multiple channels will be shown on separate
  axes, stacked above one another.

</li><p><li>Mean: A single synthetic channel will be shown, whose peaks are the
  mean of the peaks of the actual underlying channels.

</li><p><li>Butterfly: For stereo audio, a single synthetic channel will be shown,
  with the "positive" peaks corresponding to the left (first) underlying channel
  and the "negative" peaks corresponding to the right (second) channel.
</ul>

<a name="timeruler"></a><h3>6.2. &nbsp;Time Ruler</h3>

<p>The time ruler layer simply displays a series of labelled time
 divisions.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img style="max-width:100%" src="images/pane-timeruler.png"/><br><i>A time ruler layer.  The centre line is not part of the layer, but is built in to the pane.</i></div></p>

<p>Each new pane has a time ruler layer in it by default,
 although you can remove or hide it.  The time ruler layer is not editable.</p>

<a name="spectrogram"></a><h3>6.3. &nbsp;Spectrogram</h3>

<p>The spectrogram layer shows audio data in the frequency domain, with
 the Y axis corresponding to frequency and the power (or phase) of each
 frequency within a given time frame shown by the brightness or colour of
 the pixels corresponding to that frequency.</p>

<p>There are three types of spectrogram layer available in the Sonic
Visualiser menus: "plain", Melodic Range, and Peak Frequency.  These
differ only in the <a href="#defaultspectrograms">initial
properties</a> the layer is set up with.  You can always turn any kind
of spectrogram into any other kind by adjusting its properties after
it has been created.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img style="max-width:100%" src="images/pane-spectrogram.png"/><br><i>A spectrogram layer.</i></div></p>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em" src="images/params-spectrogram.png"/></p>
<p>The colour scheme used for the spectrogram can be adjusted using
the Colour properties (Colour, Threshold, and Colour Rotation).  The
Colour option allows you to select different colour maps; while most
of these are smooth gradients from one colour to another, there are
also two colour maps (Banded and Highlight) that employ sudden
transitions of colour.  These can be useful with the Colour Rotation
control to isolate areas with similar levels.</p>


<p>The type of values displayed, and the way the colour scale for the
spectrogram is calculated can be adjusted using the Scale display
properties:</p> <ul> <li>The Colour Scale property controls the
mapping from the value in each frequency bin to the colour used to
display that bin.  The mappings (Linear, Meter and dBV) are equivalent
to those available for the <a href="#waveform">waveform layer</a>
scale, and there is also a dBV^2 scale which uses a mapping
proportional to the log of the square of the bin value.  The special setting Phase will set the spectrogram to show
colours corresponding to the phase angle instead of power of each
frequency bin.

</li><p><li>The Normalize Columns switch will cause the colours in all
bins to be adjusted so that the frequency bin with the highest value
in a given time frame receives the brightest available colour.  This
will increase the overall brightness for quiet frames and may decrease
it for loud frames.

</li><p><li>The Normalize Visible Area switch will cause the colours
in all bins to be adjusted so that the frequency bin with the highest
value within the visible region of the spectrogram receives the
brightest available colour.

</li><p><li>The Gain control applies a gain to the bin values before
applying the display colour map.
</ul>

<p>The spectrogram itself is obtained from the results of a series of
fast Fourier transforms of windowed sections of the original audio.
The parameters of these transforms can be adjusted using the Window
display properties:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The size of the window can be adjusted using the Window Size property.
  This value is critical, as it directly controls the number of
  available frequency bins in the resulting spectrogram.  Smaller values
  will give a finer resolution in time; larger values will give a finer
  resolution in frequency.

</li><p><li>The overlap between consecutive windows can be adjusted
using the Window Overlap property, which determines by what proportion
of the window size the processing frames will overlap.  Using a larger
overlap will help to compensate for the reduced time
resolution of a large window size.</li>

<p><li><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em" src="images/params-windowpreference.png"/>The shape of the window applied to each section of audio data is
not adjustable from the spectrogram properties, but can be adjusted
globally in the <a href="#preferences">application preferences</a>.  The
available shaped windows are Hamming, Hanning, Blackman,
Blackman-Harris and Nuttall (cosine-based windows); Gaussian, Parzen,
triangular and un-windowed (rectangular). The Hanning window is the
default and should be appropriate for most purposes.

</li>
</ul>

<p>The scale used for the Y axis of the spectrogram can be adjusted
using the Bins properties. </p>

<ul><p><li>The Bin Display property controls the frequency bins that are
  actually shown and how they are drawn.  If set to Peak Bins, only
  those bins containing higher values than both of their frequency
  neighbours in the same time frame will be drawn.  If set to Frequencies,
  each peak's bin will be drawn with a single line at a position that
  corresponds to an estimate of the actual frequency present within the 
  bin, rather than the theoretical frequency range of the bin.  This
  instantaneous frequency estimate is arrived at by comparing the
  theoretical phase difference between consecutive time frames at the
  nominal bin frequency with the measured phase difference.

</li><p><li>The Frequency Scale property controls whether the Y axis
is proportional to frequency, or proportional to the log of the
frequency (and thus linearly proportional to musical pitch).  In the
latter case the spectrogram layer will use a stylised piano keyboard
as its vertical scale, with the C in each octave shaded in grey.
</li></ul>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em;padding-bottom:0.5em"
src="images/harmonic-cursor.png"/>If you switch to the <img
src="images/icons/select.png"/> select tool and move the mouse over
the spectrogram, it will show the "harmonic cursor" (see right).  This
is a vertical line with tick marks at the frequencies of the second
harmonic, third harmonic and so on of the frequency that the mouse is
currently pointing at.  These frequencies are simple multiples of the
fundamental, so they will be equally spaced if the frequency scale is
linear, or will get closer together as they go up if the frequency
scale is logarithmic.</p>

<p>When selecting a region of time in a spectrogram layer, the selection
 will snap to the spectrogram's processing time frames.  Hold the Shift
 key at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<a name="defaultspectrograms"></a><h4>6.3.1. &nbsp;Initial Spectrogram Properties</h4>

<p>The Sonic Visualiser pane and layer menus contain options to add
three kinds of spectrogram.  These are all the same type of layer, but
starting with different display properties.</p>

<h5>Spectrogram</h5>

<p>The plain spectrogram option creates a spectrogram that displays
the full frequency range up to half of the audio file's sampling rate,
with the vertical Frequency Scale set Linear, with Colour Scale set to
dBV, and using the default, fairly gentle green-yellow-red colour scheme.</p>

<p>This is a general overview of the content of the file, in
which background noise and overall equalisation trends may be fairly
evident but individual musical features are not usually easy to make out.</p>

<h5>Melodic Range Spectrogram</h5>

<p>The melodic range spectrogram aims to make it easier to discern
individual musically meaningful features.</p>

<p>It shows by default a
frequency range from approx 40Hz to 1.5KHz, covering around 5.5
octaves that most usually contain melodic content.  The FFT windows
are fairly large for better frequency resolution, and heavily overlapped.
The vertical Frequency Scale is logarithmic in frequency, and
therefore linear in perceived musical pitch.  The Colour Scale is
Linear, making noise and lower-level content invisible but making it
easier to pick out salient musical events, and a crisp colour scheme
is used.</p>

<h5>Peak Frequency Spectrogram</h5>

<p>The peak frequency spectrogram is similar to the melodic range
spectrogram, but it aims to make it possible to pick out precise
frequency content in the material, within certain limitations.</p>

<p>Its Bin Display is set to Frequencies, so that it displays only
those bins that are stronger then their neighbouring frequency bins,
and for each bin it calculates an estimated frequency using phase
unwrapping on the assumption that a stable frequency is present.  This
frequency is then displayed using a short horizontal line, rather than
colouring the whole bin as a block.  In good conditions this may
produce a fairly accurate estimate of the actual frequency of an
individual tone.</p>

<a name="spectrum"></a><h3 style="clear:right">6.4. &nbsp;Spectrum</h3>

<p>The spectrum layer shows a frequency analysis of the audio at a given point in time, like a vertical slice through a <a href="#spectrogram">spectrogram layer</a>.

<p><div align="center"><img style="max-width:100%" src="images/pane-spectrum.png"/><br><i>A spectrum layer.</i></div></p>

<p>In contrast to almost all of the other layer types, the x axis of a
spectrum layer does not measure time.  Instead, the spectrum's x axis
corresponds to frequency, with lower frequencies to the left and
higher to the right.  The spectrum animates appropriately to match the
movement of time during playback and navigation, instead of scrolling.
(In this respect it is closely related to the <a href="#slice">slice
layer</a>, which can display a similar slice through a <a
href="#colour3dplot">colour 3D plot</a>.)</p>

<p>The y axis of a spectrum plot shows the value of each frequency
bin, corresponding to the colour scale of the spectrogram.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em"
src="images/params-spectrum.png"/>You can adjust the FFT window size
and overlap using the Window properties, just as in the spectrogram;
and you can select the y axis scale (linear or dB), gain and
normalisation using the Scale properties.</p>

<p>The type of plot used to show the spectrum can be adjusted using the Plot Type property:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lines: The start points of the bins will be connected with straight lines.</li><p>
<li>Steps: Each bin will be drawn with a single horizontal line showing the full width of the bin's frequency coverage.</li><p>
<li>Blocks: Each bin will be drawn with an unfilled rectangular block.</li><p>
<li>Colours: Each bin will be drawn with a coloured rectangular block whose colour is based on the same colour mapping scheme as used in the spectrogram.<br>If this option is selected, the Colour property may be used to select between the available colour maps, instead of showing single colours only.</li><p>
</ul>

<p>The horizontal extent of each bin depends on the Plot X Scale
property, which selects the mapping between frequency and x coordinate
for the plot.</p>

<a name="timeinstants"></a><h3>6.5. &nbsp;Time Instants</h3>

<p>The time instants layer shows an editable sequence of points in time
 (instants), with each point displayed as a vertical bar across the
 full height of the layer.  Each instant may have a label, which will
 be displayed near the top of the instant.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img style="max-width:100%" src="images/pane-timeinstants.png"/><br><i>A time instants layer.</i></div></p>

<p>Instants can be added by clicking with the Draw tool, and edited by
 dragging with the edit tool <img src="images/icons/move.png"/>.  You can also
 double-click on an instant with the edit or navigate tool
 <img src="images/icons/navigate.png"/>to open an edit dialog in which you can change
 its label and finely adjust its timing.</p>

<p>When selecting a region of time in a time instants layer, the
 selection will snap to the nearest instants on the layer (if any).
 Hold the Shift key at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<p>When a time instants layer is active, the fast-forward and rewind
 buttons can be used to jump the playback position to the nearest
 instant in either direction.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em" src="images/params-timeinstants.png"/></p>

<p>The Plot Type display property can be used to select between Instants
 display, in which each instant is shown with a single vertical bar,
 and Segmentation display, in which the regions between instants are
 coloured in alternating shades.</p>

<p>A time instants layer has a fundamental resolution, as a number of
 audio sample frames.  Instants may only occur at multiples of this
 resolution, and are displayed using bars of a width corresponding to
 this resolution.  The default resolution is 1 audio sample frame and
 this cannot currently be changed for any given layer, although layers
 generated by certain plugin transformations may have different
 resolutions.</p>

<a name="timevalues"></a><h3>6.6. &nbsp;Time Values</h3>

<p>The time values layer shows an editable sequence of points in time,
 where each point has a value that determines its position on the Y
 axis.  Each point may also have a label.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img style="max-width:100%" src="images/pane-timevalue.png"/><br><i>A time values layer, with curve plot type.</i></div></p>

<p>Points can be added by clicking with the Draw tool, and edited by
 dragging with the edit tool <img src="images/icons/move.png"/>.  You can also double-click on a point
 with the edit or navigate tool <img src="images/icons/navigate.png"/> to open an edit dialog in which you can
 change its label and finely adjust its timing and value.</p>

<p>When selecting a region of time in a time values layer, the selection
 will snap to the nearest instants on the layer (if any).  Hold the
 Shift key at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<p>When a time values layer is active, the fast-forward and rewind
 buttons can be used to jump the playback position to the nearest
 point in either direction.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em" src="images/params-timevalue.png"/></p>

<p>The Plot Type display property can be used to adjust the display of
 points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Points: Each point will be displayed as a rectangle of width
  corresponding to the layer's time resolution.  The points will not
  be connected.

</li><p><li>Stems: Each point will be displayed as a rectangle of width
  corresponding to the layer's time resolution.  Each point will be
  connected to the zero value on the Y axis by a vertical line.

</li><p><li>Connected Points: Each point will be displayed as a rectangle of width
  corresponding to the layer's time resolution.  Each point will be
  connected to the next with a straight line.

</li><p><li>Lines: The points themselves will not be drawn explicitly; instead
  a straight line segment will be drawn between the centres of consecutive
  points, resulting in a line graph.

</li><p><li>Curve: The centres of consecutive points will be used as the control
  points of a series of cubic splines, resulting in a smooth curve.  Note
  that the curve will not pass through the actual point locations at
  local peak high and low values.

</li><p><li>Segmentation: The regions between the times of each pair of consecutive
  points will be shaded in a colour corresponding to the value of the point
  at the start of the region.
</ul>
<p>A time values layer may have a unit for the scale on the Y axis.
 If two layers with the same unit appear on the same pane, they will by
 default have vertical scales aligned with each other.  This behaviour
 can be adjusted using the Vertical Scale display property.</p>

<p>If Vertical Scale is set to Linear or Log Scale, the scale will cover
 the range of values (or logs of values) present in the layer; if set
 to "+/-1", it will cover the range from -1 to +1 and points with
 values outside that range will be omitted.</p>

<p>If the Vertical Scale for a layer is set to anything other than
 Auto-Align, then any other layers in the same pane that have the same
 unit and that have Vertical Scale set to Auto-Align will align
 themselves to match it.</p>

<p>You can change the scale unit for a layer by selecting from, or editing
 the value in, the Scale Units property combo-box.</p>

<p>A time values layer has a fundamental resolution, as a number of audio
 sample frames.  Points may only occur at times that are multiples of
 this resolution, and they may be displayed using boxes of a width
 corresponding to this resolution.  The default resolution is 1 audio
 sample frame and this cannot currently be changed for any given layer,
 although layers generated by certain plugin transformations may have
 different resolutions.</p>

<a name="notes"></a><h3>6.7. &nbsp;Notes</h3>

<p>The notes layer shows an editable sequence of notes, where each note
 has a start time, a duration, and a value that determines its position
 on the Y axis.  Each note may also have a label.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img style="max-width:100%" src="images/pane-notes.png"/><br><i>A note layer.</i></div></p>

<p>Notes can be added by clicking and dragging with the Draw tool, and
 edited by dragging with the edit tool <img src="images/icons/move.png"/>.  You can also double-click on a
 note with the edit or navigate tool <img src="images/icons/navigate.png"/> to open an edit dialog in which
 you can change its label and finely adjust its timing and value.</p>

<p>When selecting a region of time in a notes layer, the selection will
 snap to the start times of the nearest notes on the layer (if any).
 Hold the Shift key at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<p>A notes layer may have a unit for the scale on the Y axis.
 If two layers with the same unit appear on the same pane, they will by
 default have vertical scales aligned with each other.  This behaviour
 can be adjusted using the Vertical Scale display property.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em" src="images/params-notes.png"/></p>

<p>If Vertical Scale is set to Linear or Log Scale, the scale will cover
 the range of values (or logs of values) present in the layer; if set
 to "MIDI Note Range", it will cover the range from MIDI notes 0 to 127
 and values outside that range will be omitted.</p>

<p>If the Vertical Scale for a layer is set to anything other than
 Auto-Align, then any other layers in the same pane that have the same
 unit and that have Vertical Scale set to Auto-Align will align
 themselves to match it.</p>

<p>You can change the scale unit for a layer by selecting from, or
 editing the value in, the Pitch Units property combo-box.  However, if
 the scale unit is anything other than "Hz", the layer will assume that
 the values correspond to MIDI pitch and will convert them to Hz when
 calculating display and alignment.</p>

<p>A notes layer has a fundamental resolution, as a number of audio
 sample frames.  Notes may only occur at times that are multiples of
 this resolution.  The default resolution is 1 audio sample frame and
 this cannot currently be changed for any given layer, although layers
 generated by certain plugin transformations may have different
 resolutions.</p>

<a name="text"></a><h3>6.8. &nbsp;Text</h3>

<p>The text layer shows text annotation labels.  Each label is fixed to a
 particular position in time, and appears at a particular height on the
 layer.  The text layer is intended for informal or descriptive
 annotations that are not attached to other sorts of features (as the
 other editable layer types allow their points to have labels as well).</p>

<p>Labels can be added by clicking with the Draw tool, and moved by
 dragging with the edit tool <img src="images/icons/move.png"/>.  You can also double-click on a label
 with the edit or navigate tool <img src="images/icons/navigate.png"/> to open an edit dialog.  (You may need
 to click at the top-left corner of the text label for an edit to take
 effect.)</p>

<p>When selecting a region of time in a text layer, the selection will
 snap to the nearest label on the layer (if any).  Hold the Shift key
 at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<a name="colour3dplot"></a><h3>6.9. &nbsp;Colour 3D Plot</h3>

<p>The colour 3D plot layer displays a three-dimensional data set in a
 grid.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img style="max-width:100%" src="images/pane-colour3dplot.png"/><br><i>A colour 3D plot layer.</i></div></p>

<p>It is used for data sets which have a discrete time axis, a set of
bins at each time position, and a value in each bin.  (In this respect
it resembles the <a href="#spectrogram">spectrogram</a>, except that the
spectrogram also knows about frequencies, window sizes and so on.)
The grid x and y coordinates correspond to the time and bin
respectively, and each grid square is coloured according to the value
in the corresponding bin.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em"
src="images/params-colour3dplot.png"/>You can change the colour map
used for the value scale using the Colour property; adjust whether the
colour is mapped to a linear or logarithmic scale using the Scale
property; and also choose to normalise the individual columns
of the plot (so that the highest value in each always receives the
brightest available colour) or the visible area of the plot (so that
the highest visible value receives the brightest available colour).</p>

<p>The colour 3D plot layer is not editable.  For this reason, you
cannot add an empty colour 3D plot layer using the Layer menu, because
you would then be unable to do anything with it.  These layers only
appeard when a <a href="#plugins">transform</a> whose output is
appropriate for grid display is applied, or when <a
href="#layerimport">importing</a> certain types of annotation
data.</p>

<a name="slice"></a><h4>6.9.1. &nbsp;Slices</h4>

<p>A slice layer shows an instantaneous graph of the values present
along the Y axis of a colour 3D plot layer, at the moment
corresponding to the current centre frame.  A slice is to a colour 3D
plot as a <a href="#spectrum">spectrum</a> is to a <a
href="#spectrogram">spectrogram</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a colour 3D plot layer present in Sonic Visualiser, you
can add a slice layer for it using the Add Slice of Layer option in
the Layer menu.</p>

<a name="plugins"></a><h2>7. &nbsp;Transforms and Plugins</h2>

<a name="transform"></a><h3>7.1. &nbsp;The Transform Menu</h3>

<p>The Transform menu contains all of the available means of
generating new layers with new data in them, using various kinds of
binary plugin.  If the Transform menu is empty, then you need to get
some plugins!</p>

<p>Several types of plugin-based transform are available.</p>

<a name="vampplugins"></a><h3>7.2. &nbsp;Analysis Plugins</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser can generate layers using audio analysis and
feature extraction plugins, which may be provided by third party
developers or institutions.  The native plugin format is called Vamp
(see <a
href="http://www.vamp-plugins.org"><code>http://www.vamp-plugins.org</code></a>).
Vamp plugins take audio inputs and can generate outputs suitable for
display in any of Sonic Visualiser's standard types of layer.</p>

<p>If you have any Vamp plugins installed, Sonic Visualiser will show
them in the Analysis section of the Transform menu.  This section
contains three menus, sorting the available plugin outputs according
to plugin category, plugin name, or the maker of the plugin.  Category
information is obtained from an optional <code>.cat</code> file
associated with each plugin library; Vamp plugins that lack categories
will appear in an Unclassified section.  (Advanced users may set up
their own category hierarchy by making and installing their own
<code>.cat</code> files: the file format is a simple textual one
easily made by copy-paste and editing existing files.)</p>

<p>Selecting an analysis plugin output will generate a new layer in
the current pane, containing the output produced by that plugin from
the main audio waveform.  If the plugin has any configurable
parameters, you will be shown a configuration dialog before the plugin
is run.  If you have more than one audio file or generated audio
waveform present in Sonic Visualiser, this dialog will also allow you
to select which of them will be used as the input to the plugin.</p>

<p>The processing step and block sizes for Vamp plugins are set by
negotiation with the plugin, with a default of 1024 audio sample
frames in cases where the plugin does not have a preference.  You can
change these sizes, and also adjust the behaviour of plugins that
operate on single-channel audio when using a multi-channel audio file,
from the Advanced options section of the plugin's configuration
dialog.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.vamp-plugins.org/download.html">Vamp
plugin download page</a> to find out about some of the available Vamp
plugins and how to install them.  See the <a
href="http://www.vamp-plugins.org/develop.html">Vamp API
documentation</a> for details of the plugin format and how to develop
new Vamp plugins.</p>

<a name="ladspaplugins"></a><h3>7.3. &nbsp;Effects Plugins</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser also supports effects plugins in the <a
href="http://www.ladspa.org/">LADSPA</a> and <a
href="http://dssi.sourceforge.net/">DSSI</a> formats.  These are
originally Linux plugin formats, but are portable to other
platforms as well, and many LADSPA effects in particular are available
for most popular platforms.</p>

<p>Effects plugins can be used to generate new layers in more than one
way, and so if you have any installed, you will see up to three
corresponding sections in the Transform menu.</p>

<a name="effects"></a><h4>7.3.1. &nbsp;Effects</h4>

<p>The Effects section of the Transform menu lists plugins that take
audio as input and convert it to audio output.  This is the most usual mode
of operation for an effects plugin.</p>

<p>Selecting an effects plugin will generate a new layer in the
current pane, containing the new audio waveform produced by that
plugin.  If the plugin has any configurable parameters, you will be
shown a configuration dialog before the plugin is run.  If you have
more than one audio file or generated audio waveform present in Sonic
Visualiser, this dialog will also allow you to select which of them
will be used as the input to the plugin.</p>

<p>The processing block size for effects plugins defaults to 1024 audio
sample frames.  You can change this, and also adjust the behaviour of
plugins that operate on single-channel audio when using a
multi-channel audio file, from the Advanced options section of the
plugin's configuration dialog.</p>

<a name="effectsdata"></a><h4>7.3.2. &nbsp;Effects Data</h4>

<p>Sonic Visualiser can also generate layers from "control-rate"
outputs of effects plugins.  These are referred to as Effects Data.</p>

<p>For example, a compressor plugin may (in addition to its audio
outputs) have a control-rate output that returns the measured dB level
of the audio.  Sonic Visualiser can use this output to create a new <a
href="#timevalues">time values</a> layer, by running the compressor
and effectively discarding its audio output, keeping only the
control-rate output.  Other plugins may have other control-rate
outputs with different uses.</p>

<p>If you have any plugins installed that can be used in this way,
they will appear in the Effects Data section of the Transform menu.
In most cases, these will be the control-rate outputs of plugins whose
audio outputs also appear under Effects.  Some plugins intended only
for measurement use may have only control-rate outputs and no audio
outputs; such a plugin will only appear under Effects Data and not
under Effects.</p>

<p>Selecting an effects plugin output from the Effects Data section
will generate a new layer in the current pane, containing a time value
layer showing the output produced by that plugin.  If the plugin has
any configurable parameters, you will be shown a configuration dialog
before the plugin is run.  If you have more than one audio file or
generated audio waveform present in Sonic Visualiser, this dialog will
also allow you to select which of them will be used as the input to
the plugin.</p>

<p>The processing block size for effects plugins defaults to 1024 audio
sample frames.  You can change this, and also adjust the behaviour of
plugins that operate on single-channel audio when using a
multi-channel audio file, from the Advanced options section of the
plugin's configuration dialog.</p>

<a name="generators"></a><h4>7.3.3. &nbsp;Generators</h4>

<p>Finally, some "effects" plugins have only audio outputs, and no
inputs.  They generate new audio data usually based on various
controlling parameters, and are referred to as Generators.  Useful
examples include sine-wave tone generators, white and pink noise
generators and so on.  These can be handy for generating comparative
signals or signals to test processing algorithms for plugin
development purposes.</p>

<p>Sonic Visualiser does not support generating new layers from what
are traditionally known as instrument or synth plugins, which create
audio output from "note event" inputs.  It also does not support
varying the control parameters of a generator plugin during operation.
Finally, a current limitation is that generators can only be used to
produce an additional waveform when you already have at least one
audio file present &ndash; you cannot use a generator to create the
only audio file in a previously empty Sonic Visualiser session.</p>

<p>If you have any effects plugins installed that Sonic Visualiser can
use in this way, they will appear in the Generators section of the
Transform menu.</p>

<p>Selecting a plugin output from the Generators section will generate
a new layer in the current pane, containing the new audio waveform
produced by that plugin.  If the plugin has any configurable
parameters, you will be shown a configuration dialog before the plugin
is run.</p>

<p>The processing block size for effects plugins defaults to 1024
audio sample frames.  You can change this from the Advanced options
section of the plugin's configuration dialog.</p>

<a name="preferences"></a><h2>10. &nbsp;Application Preferences</h2>

<p>The Application Preferences window (available through the
Preferences option of the File menu) contains a number of things which
may be adjusted to change the display or calculations carried out by
Sonic Visualiser.</p>

<ul><li>Property box layout: This preference controls how the layer <a
href="#layeredits">display property boxes</a> are arranged on the
right side of the Sonic Visualiser window.  If set to "Show boxes for
all panes" (the default), each pane will have a set of display
property boxes to its right.  If set to "Show box for current pane
only", there will be only one set of property boxes, and each time the
current pane changes, the property boxes will be updated to reflect
that new pane.  This permits the panes to be smaller, because their
sizes are not constrained by the sizes of the property boxes, and
consequently allows you to fit more panes on the screen.</li>

<p><li>Frequency of concert A: This is the frequency that will be used
as the reference for a "concert A" (the A above middle C) when drawing
the vertical scale on log-frequency <a
href="#spectrogram">spectrograms</a> or calculating automatic
alignments between spectrogram and <a href="#notes">note layers</a>.</li>

<p><li>Playback resampler type: Selects the resampler that will be
used during playback of audio files that need to be resampled for the
current playback audio device.</li>

<p><li>Spectrogram y-axis smoothing: Selects the smoothing style for
<a href="#spectrogram">spectrogram</a> bins that take up more than one
vertical pixel.  When displaying a linear-frequency spectrogram with a
relatively small FFT window size (i.e. a small number of vertical
bins), or a log-frequency spectrogram in which a single bin at a low
frequency occupies a relatively large space vertically, or when zoomed
in close up to any spectrogram, the visible "blockiness" of the
spectrogram can be reduced by applying smoothing.<br><br>The highest
quality (but slowest) smoothing is provided by the "Zero pad FFT"
option; the "Interpolate" option provides faster but lower quality
smoothing.<br><br>Be aware that although smoothing may make the
"trend" of a spectrogram contour easier to perceive, it does not
actually increase the meaningful resolution of the spectrogram:
instead it just interpolates from the values that were there already.
To raise the actual vertical resolution, you need to increase the
spectrogram window size &ndash; with a consequent reduction in
horizontal resolution, that can be compensated for to a certain degree
by increasing the window overlap.</li>

<p><li>Spectral analysis window shape: When calculating FFT data for
spectral applications such as spectrogram or as frequency-domain input
for Vamp plugins, Sonic Visualiser uses the standard practice of
multiplying each block of time-domain audio data with a shaped window
before passing it to the FFT.  The resulting spectral domain data
contains artifacts corresponding to the FFT of the window shape; the
shape of the window is chosen to reduce those artifacts in comparison
to the effectively rectangular window that would apply if no other
shape was used.<br><br>The window shape used for this procedure can be
selected here.  The shape of the chosen window in the time domain (on
the left) and frequency domain (on the right, the result of an FFT of
the time-domain window shape) are displayed above the window shape
selection menu.  The default Hanning window is appropriate for most
purposes.</li>
