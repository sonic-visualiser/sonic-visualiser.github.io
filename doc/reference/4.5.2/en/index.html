<p>Sonic Visualiser is an application for viewing and analysing the
contents of music audio files.  This is a brief reference manual
explaining the concepts used in Sonic Visualiser and how to use it.
This manual describes Sonic Visualiser version 4.5.2.</p>

<a name="panesandlayers"></a><h2>1 &nbsp;Panes and Layers</h2>

<a name="paneconcepts"></a><h3 class="first">1.1 &nbsp;What are Panes and Layers?</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser's user interface is structured around <i>panes</i>
and <i>layers</i>.  A pane is a horizontally scrollable area of window
like a drawing canvas; a layer is one of a set of things that can be
shown on a pane, such as a waveform, a line graph of measurements,
or a subdivision of the horizontal axis into differently coloured segments.</p>

<p>You can stack any number of panes above one another vertically: a
scrollbar will appear if you have too many to fit in the window.  The
horizontal axis of each pane corresponds to time in audio sample
frames, and all of the stacked panes will be aligned to the same
sample frame at their centre points.</p>

<p>Each pane can then display any number of layers, which are
conceptually stacked on top of one another like layers in a graphics
application.  So for example, you may have a spectrogram layer "at the
back", with line data, onset positions and notes displayed in
separate layers "in front", i.e. drawn over the top of it.  There are
several different kinds of layer, which differ in the types of data
they can represent: instants, curves (time-value plots), and so
on.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/pane-layers.png"/><br><i>A pane with four layers: <a href="#waveform">waveform</a> in black, <a href="#timeruler">time ruler</a> in grey, <a href="#timevalues">time values</a> in purple and <a href="#timeinstants">time instants</a> in blue.</i></div></p>

<p>Layers that are stacked on the same pane will always share the same
 magnification (or zoom) and alignment on the x (time) axis.  However,
 they do not have to have identical scales on the y axis &mdash;
 although Sonic Visualiser will attempt to align them vertically by
 default if their scale units match.</p>

<p style="clear:left"><img style="float:left;padding-top:0.3em;padding-right:1em"
src="images/active.png"/> One pane is always the "active" pane, and
this one is marked with a black vertical bar to its left, like the one
by this paragraph.  The front layer on that pane is the active layer.
Any menu or keyboard function in Sonic Visualiser that works on a
single layer will always operate on the active layer.</p>

<p>Many of the annotation layer types are interactively editable on
 the pane itself. The exceptions are those layers corresponding
 directly to audio data (such as waveform and spectrogram layers), and
 those showing dense information such as grids.</p>

<a name="paneadding"></a><h3>1.2 &nbsp;Adding Panes and Layers</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser starts with a single visible pane.  When you
import an audio file, it adds <a href="#timeruler">time ruler</a> and
<a href="#waveform">waveform</a> layers to that pane, displaying the
new audio file.

<p>There are then three menus dedicated to adding new panes and layers
to the display, with various kinds of data in them:</p>

<ul>

<li>The Pane menu contains several functions to add new panes
displaying audio data.<br>Use the Add Waveform and Add Spectrum
functions to add a new pane containing a <a
href="#waveform">waveform</a> or <a href="#spectrum">spectrum</a>
layer.  Use one of the three Add Spectrogram functions to add a pane
with a <a href="#spectrogram">spectrogram</a> layer with a particular
set of <a href="#defaultspectrograms">initial properties</a>. You can
also add an empty pane and add layers to it afterwards.</li><p>

<li>The Layer menu contains the same functions as the Pane menu.  When
invoked from the Layer menu, they add a new layer to the current pane
instead of adding a whole new pane.<br>The Layer menu also contains
functions to add empty layers of each of the editable layer
types: <a href="#timeinstants">time
instants</a>, <a href="#timevalues">time
values</a>, <a href="#notes">notes</a>, <a href="#regions">regions</a>, <a href="#boxes">boxes</a>, <a href="#text">text</a>,
and <a href="#images">images</a>.<br>You can also add an existing
layer (one that is already shown in a different pane) to the current
pane, thus displaying the same thing more than once, or add a
<a href="#slice">slice</a> of an existing <a
href="#colour3dplot">colour 3D plot</a> layer.</li><p>

<li>The <a href="#transform">Transform menu</a> lists things you can
do to your audio in order to produce new layers with data in them. You
will have to have some plugins installed in order for this menu to
show anything useful.  Transforms include feature extractors, which
produce annotation or visualisation data from audio inputs, and
effects, which produce more audio by processing audio inputs.
See <a href="#plugins">Transforms and Plugins</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can also add a new layer by <a
href="#layerimport">importing</a> an existing set of annotation data from a file.

<a name="layeredits"></a><h3>1.3 &nbsp;Display Properties</h3>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/params-spectrogram.png"/>Each
layer, whether editable or not, has a set of adjustable display
properties.  These are shown in a tabbed box to the right of the pane,
with one tab for each layer in the pane. Clicking on the numbered tab
brings the corresponding layer to the front of the pane and makes it
the active layer.

<p>To save space, not all of the names of the properties are shown;
you can hold the mouse pointer over a control to see the name of its
property in a tooltip or the status line at the bottom of the main
window. And if you right-click on a control, a menu will pop up
showing the name and current value of the property and offering some
editing options.</p>

<p>The available properties for the each type of layer are discussed
in the sections about the individual layer types, later in this
reference. There are also <a href="#sonification">audio playback
controls</a> at the bottom of the boxes for many layer types.</p>

<p><img class="left-very-modest" src="images/params-pane.png"/>There
is also a tab corresponding to the pane itself, which can be used to
control the way the pane scrolls during playback and whether it moves
and zooms in sync with other panes.</p><p>The Global Scroll and Global
Zoom settings (both on by default) make the pane follow any horizontal
scrolling and zooming that happens in other panes that also have these
settings on, so that when you scroll or zoom in one of them, they all
scroll or zoom.</p><p>The Follow Playback control allows you to choose
whether the pane will track playback using a playback cursor, paging
when it reaches the edge of the pane (Page); or whether it will scroll
along with the playback (Scroll); or neither.</p>

<a name="layerzoom"></a><h3>1.4 &nbsp;Zoom and Scrolling</h3>

    <p>There are various ways to
      control the zoom (i.e. level of magnification) and scrolling
      (i.e. left/right or up/down positioning) of the current pane.</p>


    <a name="layerzoomzoom"></a><h4>1.4.1 &nbsp;Zoom</h4>

    <p>To adjust the zoom level, you can:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Scroll with the mouse wheel, or use two-finger vertical
	trackpad scrolling;</li>
      <p>

      <li>Press the Up or Down cursor keys to zoom in or out
      respectively, or hit the F key (a shortcut for View &rarr; Zoom to
      Fit) to zoom out so that the whole file is visible;</li>
      <p>
      
      <li><img class="right-teeny"
      src="images/pane-zoomwheels.png"/>Use the zoom wheels, which
      appear in the bottom-right corner of the pane. (If they aren't
      visible, go to View &rarr; Show Zoom Wheels or press the Z key.)
      These are loosely intended to resemble thumbwheels "set into"
      the display.<br>The horizontal wheel can be dragged left or
      right to adjust the horizontal zoom, that is, zoom in the time
      axis.<br>The vertical wheel, and the vertical panner control
      next to it, only appear if the current layer is one which can
      also be zoomed in the vertical axis: then the wheel controls the
      vertical zoom level, and you can drag the panner thumb to scroll
      vertically.<br>Click the small empty box at the bottom-right
      corner to reset both zoom levels to their defaults.<br>As with
      many of the controls in Sonic Visualiser, you can double-click
      the zoom wheels to type a new value directly, and click with the
      Ctrl button pressed or using the middle mouse button to reset
      them to the default.
	
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Generally when you change the zoom level in any one pane, all
    of the other panes zoom to match. But you can also uncheck the
    "Global Zoom" option in a pane's <a href="#layeredits">display
    properties</a> to switch it to zooming independently from the
    rest.</p>
    
    <a name="layerzoomzoom"></a><h4>1.4.2 &nbsp;Zooming to an Area</h4>

    <p>If some area of a layer is of particular interest, such as a
      time-frequency area of a spectrogram or a specific period of
      time in a waveform or annotation layer, you can also zoom into
      that area directly so that it fills the whole pane in both axes.</p>

    <p>To do this, ensure the default Navigate tool is selected
    (see <a href="#tools">Tools</a> below), and hold down the Shift
    key while clicking and dragging out a rectangular area of a pane
    (which will be shown surrounded by a blue box on the pane). When
    you release the mouse button, the pane will be zoomed to that
    area.</p>
    
    <a name="layerzoomscroll"></a><h4>1.4.3 &nbsp;Scrolling</h4>

    <p>To scroll along the time axis within the current file, you can:</p>

    <ul><li>Use two-finger horizontal trackpad scrolling;</li>
      <p>
	<li>Scroll with the mouse wheel, or use vertical trackpad
	scrolling, while holding the Alt key;</li>
      <p>
	<li>Click and drag the pane, while
	the <a href="#tools">Navigate tool</a> is active;</li>
      <p>
	<li>Press the Left or Right cursor keys to move a small step at a time, or with Ctrl pressed as well to move a larger step.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>All of the above scrolling methods move the playback position
    (keeping it in the centre of the pane) as well as scrolling the
    pane. But you can also scroll only the current pane while leaving
    the playback position unchanged, by holding the Alt key while
    using the left and right cursor keys. This is referred to in the
      View menu as "peek"ing left or right.</p>

    <p>Finally, you can click and drag in the small overview waveform
    shown at the bottom of the main window, to scroll all of the panes
    without moving the playback position.</p>

    <p>As with zooming, you can also uncheck the "Global Scroll"
    option in a pane's <a href="#layeredits">display properties</a> to
    switch that pane so that it no longer follows the rest when you
    scroll one of them.</p>

<a name="sessionsandundo"></a><h2 style="clear:both">2 &nbsp;Sessions and Undo</h2>

<p>A Sonic Visualiser "session" is a record of almost everything you see
 in front of you in the Sonic Visualiser window: the current layout of panes, the set
 of layers on each one, all of the data in each of the editable layers,
 a reference to the source data (for example the audio file) for
 non-editable layers like waveforms, the display properties for each
 layer, and some information about where each layer came from (for
 example, whether it was generated by a plugin and if so, which plugin
 and how it was configured.)</p>

<p>You can save the entire session to a <code>.sv</code> session file using File -&gt;
 Save Session As...  Reloading this file should restore your session
 state, provided that the original audio file can also be found.  (If
 you are passing session files to other Sonic Visualiser users, be sure to make sure
 they have the audio data as well, as this is never stored in the
 session file.)</p>

<p>Sonic Visualiser provides full multi-level Undo and Redo.  Almost all actions that
 change the session you see in front of you &mdash; with the exception of
 scrolling and zooming &mdash; can be undone.  This includes adding and
 removing layers and panes and changing the display properties for a
 layer, as well as more conventional edits.</p>

<a name="tools"></a><h2>3 &nbsp;Tools</h2>

<p>Sonic Visualiser has six "tools", which control the way mouse actions interact with
 the panes.  These can be activated using the tool icons on the toolbar:</p>
<ul>
<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/navigate.svg"/> Navigate tool. Used for basic viewing and navigating.  With
  this tool active, you can just click and drag anywhere on a pane
  to move the view of the audio data around.  This tool is active by
  default, except when a new empty editable layer has just been added, when the draw tool (below) is made active.

</li><p><li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/select.svg"/> Select tool. Used for selecting areas.
  Click and drag in any pane to select a time extent.  See also
  <a href="#selection">Selection</a>, below.

</li><p><li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/> Edit tool. Used for moving items in editable layers.

</li><p><li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/draw.svg"/> Draw tool. Used for adding items to editable layers.

</li><p><li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/erase.svg"/> Erase tool. Used for removing items from editable layers.

</li><p><li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/measure.svg"/> Measure tool. Used
to make measurements of areas within a layer in terms of time and scale
values.  See <a href="#measurements">Measurements</a>.

</li>

</ul>
<a name="selection"></a><h2>4 &nbsp;Selection</h2>

<p>With the select tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/select.svg"/> active, click and drag
 within any pane to select a time extent.</p>

<p>The selection boundaries will snap to the resolution or features
 present on the active layer.  For example, if you drag a selection on
 a spectrogram layer, the selection's boundaries will be aligned with
 the spectrogram's FFT window hops; if you drag a selection on a
 time-instants layer, its boundaries will snap to instants present on
 the layer; if you drag a selection on a waveform layer, its boundaries
 will simply snap to audio sample frames.</p>

<p>Pressing Shift as you start dragging a selection will defeat this snap
 effect, forcing the selection to snap to the nearest audio sample to
 each pixel boundary.</p>

<p>You can select additional areas as well, by holding Ctrl as you
 start selecting the second and subsequent areas, which adds the new
 areas to the existing selection instead of extending it or starting a
 new one.</p>

<p>You can also click-drag the left and right edges of a selection to
 change its extents after it has been made.</p>

<p>A selection within Sonic Visualiser conceptually consists of one or
 more time extents.  When you select an extent in a layer, you are
 selecting a period of time across all layers; you are not selecting
 the visible items that happen to fall within that area in that one
 layer.</p>

<p>This has several consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>If more than one item occurs at the same time in the same layer,
  there is no way to select only some of them.

</li><p><li>Even if items in a layer are above or below the visible range of the
  layer's vertical scale (i.e. off the top or bottom of the pane),
  they will still be selected if they fall within a selected time area.

</li><p><li>If you make a selection in one layer and
  then make a different layer active before carrying out an editing
  action that operates on the active layer, it will operate on the new
  active layer &mdash; not on the items in the layer you originally made
  the selection in.
</ul>
<p>An advantage of this is that it is very easy to select all the items
 in one layer that fall between certain items in another layer &mdash; make
 the second layer active, make a selection (which will snap to the item
 positions on that layer), then make the first layer active again.</p>

<a name="editing"></a><h2>5 &nbsp;Editing</h2>

<p>Most of Sonic Visualiser's annotation layer types are interactively editable.
 Layers corresponding directly to audio data (such as waveform
 and spectrogram layers) are not editable.  Sonic Visualiser is not an audio editor.</p>

<p>To move an individual item in a layer, make sure the
 edit tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/> is active and then click on and drag
 the item.  If the item is relatively wide on the screen, you may have
 to click and drag its left hand edge for the drag to take effect.</p>

<p>When dragging an item, there is a certain amount of "resistance"
 when you first move the mouse before the item begins to move (to help
 avoid accidental edits).  You can override this by holding down the
 Shift key when you start dragging, if you want to make a small
 correction.</p>

<p>You can also edit the details of an item directly, by double-clicking
 on it with either the navigate <img class="icon" src="images/icons/navigate.svg"/> or edit <img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/> tool selected.  (The advantage
 of using the navigate tool is that it removes the risk of
 accidentally editing the point while double-clicking on it.)</p>

<p>To move a set of items at once, <a href="#selection">select</a> the area around them, then switch to the edit tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/> and drag the selected
 area.</p>

<p>To delete one or more items click on them with the erase <img class="icon" src="images/icons/erase.svg"/> tool selected, or <a href="#selection">select</a> the area around them and use Edit &rarr; Delete Selected Items.

<a name="cutandpaste"></a><h3>5.1 &nbsp;Cut and Paste</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser allows you to cut and paste between layers of different types,
 preserving as much information as can be reconciled with the layer
 types.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em;padding-bottom:1em" src="images/paste-options.png"/>To cut and paste between two layers, <a href="#selection">select</a> the items in the source
 layer, use Edit -&gt; Cut, select the target layer and Edit -&gt; Paste.
 The items will be pasted at the same location in time as they were
 found in the source layer.</p>

<p>If the target layer is of a type that represents less information
than the source &mdash; for example if you are pasting to a time
instant layer from a time/value curve &mdash; then the relevant
information (in this case time positions) will be retained, and the
rest discarded.</p>

<p>
If the target layer represents more information than the source,
you will be offered various options for how to make up the values that
are not present in the pasted items (as shown to the right).

<p>If no suitable target layer is selected at all (for example, if the
layer that is active when you ask to paste is not of an editable
type), then a new layer of the most appropriate type will be created
automatically and the values will be pasted into it.</p>

<a name="dataeditor"></a><h3>5.2 &nbsp;The Data Editor</h3>

<p><img
style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em;padding-bottom:1em"
src="images/data-editor.png"/>You can also view and edit data for a
layer directly in the data editor window.  If the current layer is an
editable one, you can call up this window through the Edit Layer Data
option on the Layer menu.</p>

<p>You can edit any of the values in this layer simply by
double-clicking on a value and typing a new one.  If you want to edit
one of the real-time values in the first column, enter the new value
in seconds.  Undo applies to any edits made in this window.</p>

<p>By default, this window will scroll to keep time with playback.
You can toggle this behaviour using the <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/playfollow.svg"> Track Playback button in the
toolbar.</p>

<p>Although you can select items in the data editor window and delete
them as well as inserting new ones, there is no connection between the

<a name="layerdetails"></a><h2 style="clear:right">6 &nbsp;The Layers in Detail</h2>

<a name="waveform"></a><h3 class="first">6.1 &nbsp;Waveform</h3>

<p>The waveform layer shows audio data in a traditional waveform peak
 display.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/pane-waveform.png"/><br><i>A waveform layer.</i></div></p>

<p>Each pixel on the horizontal axis shows the peak and mean positive and
 negative values found in samples falling within that pixel's range at
 the current zoom level.  The zoom level can be increased or decreased
 using the mouse wheel or the Up and Down cursor keys.</p>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/params-waveform.png"/></p>

<p>The Y axis scale can be adjusted using the Scale display properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear (the default): The scale displacement is proportional to the voltage level
  of the resulting audio output.

</li><p><li>dB: The scale displacement is proportional to the log of the
  absolute voltage.

</li><p><li>Meter: An intermediate scale is used that may be non-linear, intended to make peaks more apparent than the dB scale but quiet sections easier to see than the linear scale.
</ul>
<p>The Scale properties also provide a display gain control, and a
 "Normalize Visible Area" switch which will adjust the display gain
 continuously so as to ensure full scale displacement for the largest
 value in the visible section of the waveform.</p>

<p>The way the waveform layer handles multiple channels can be adjusted
 using the Channels display property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate (the default): Multiple channels will be shown on separate
  axes, stacked above one another.

</li><p><li>Mean: A single synthetic channel will be shown, whose peaks are the
  mean of the peaks of the actual underlying channels.

</li><p><li>Butterfly: For stereo audio, a single synthetic channel will be shown,
  with the "positive" peaks corresponding to the left (first) underlying channel
  and the "negative" peaks corresponding to the right (second) channel.
</ul>

<a name="waveform-detail"></a><h4>6.1.1 &nbsp;Waveform Interpolation</h4>

    <p>If you zoom close enough into a waveform layer, Sonic
      Visualiser will switch from showing the peak values for each
      pixel, to showing individual samples as points connected by
      lines:
      </p>

    <p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/waveform-interpolating.png"/></div></p>

    <p>The lines in this view represent the result of interpolating
    between the samples in such a way that the resulting signal is
    bandlimited in frequency to twice the sampling rate. Although
    there are infinitely many ways to draw a path through all the
    points, there is only one way to do so with a signal that doesn't
    contain any components of higher frequencies, and Sonic Visualiser
    aims to represent that. (A digital-to-analogue audio converter
    also approximates the same behaviour.)</p>

    <p><img class="right-wider" src="images/waveform-sinc.png"/>For
    example, if you load a file that contains all zeros except for a
    single sample of value 1, then zoom in very closely, you will see
    a shape like that shown on the right. This particular curve, known
    as the sinc function, is the shape of a signal that passes through
    these points "smoothly" enough not to contain any frequencies
    above twice the sampling rate.
    </p>

    <p style="clear:both">Note that this interpolation only happens
    when the layer is zoomed in far enough to show the individual
    sample points. The rest of the time, the displayed peak heights
    are based on sample values alone. A signal may have peaks in
    between samples that exceed any of the individual sample values,
    but such extremes will not be visible until you zoom in.</p>

<a name="timeruler"></a><h3>6.2 &nbsp;Time Ruler</h3>

<p>The time ruler layer simply displays a series of labelled time
 divisions.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/pane-timeruler.png"/><br><i>A time ruler layer.  The centre line is not part of the layer, but is built in to the pane.</i></div></p>

<p>Each new pane has a time ruler layer in it by default,
 although you can remove or hide it.  The time ruler layer is not editable.</p>

<a name="spectrogram"></a><h3>6.3 &nbsp;Spectrogram</h3>

<p>The spectrogram layer shows audio data in the frequency domain, with
 the Y axis corresponding to frequency and the power (or phase) of each
 frequency within a given time frame shown by the brightness or colour of
 the pixels corresponding to that frequency.</p>

<p>There are three types of spectrogram layer available in the Sonic
Visualiser menus: "plain", Melodic Range, and Peak Frequency.  These
differ only in the <a href="#defaultspectrograms">initial
properties</a> the layer is set up with.  You can always turn any kind
of spectrogram into any other kind by adjusting its properties after
it has been created.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/pane-spectrogram.png"/><br><i>A spectrogram layer.</i></div></p>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/params-spectrogram.png"/></p>
<p>The colour scheme used for the spectrogram can be adjusted using
the Colour properties (Colour, Threshold, and Colour Rotation). The
Colour option allows you to select different colour maps; while most
of these are smooth gradients from one colour to another, there are
also two colour maps (Banded and Highlight) that employ sudden
transitions of colour.  These can be useful with the Colour Rotation
control to isolate areas with similar levels.</p>

<p>The type of values displayed, and the way the colour scale for the
spectrogram is calculated can be adjusted using the Scale display
  properties:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The Colour Scale property controls the mapping from the value in
each frequency bin to the colour used to display that bin.  The
mappings (Linear, Meter and dBV) are equivalent to those available for
the <a href="#waveform">waveform layer</a> scale, and there is also a
dBV^2 scale which uses a mapping proportional to the log of the square
of the bin value.  The special setting Phase will set the spectrogram
to show colours corresponding to the phase angle instead of power of
    each frequency bin.</li><p>

    <li>The Normalization property adjusts normalization of individual
    bins in various ways that can be used to increase visibility:

      <ul><li><img class="icon"
src="images/icons/normalise-columns.svg"/> <i>Col</i> (column
normalization) causes the colours in all bins to be adjusted so that
the bin with the highest value in a given column receives the
brightest available colour regardless of how high its value is
relative to the neighbouring columns. This will increase the overall
brightness for quiet frames and may decrease it for loud frames.

</li><li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/normalise.svg"/> <i>View</i>
(visible view normalization) causes the colours in all bins to be
adjusted so that the bin with the highest value within the entire
visible area of the spectrogram receives the brightest available
colour.

    </li><li><i>Hybrid</i> normalization causes the colours in all
        bins to be adjusted so that the bin with the highest value
        within a column receives a colour representative of the
        base-10 logarithm of its original value, with the other bins
        assigned as a proportion of that. This flattens out the
        difference in level between subsequent columns, but not as
        much as Column normalization does.</p>
</li></ul>

</li><p><li>The Gain control applies a gain to the bin values before
applying the display colour map.
</ul>

<p>The spectrogram itself is obtained from the results of a series of
fast Fourier transforms of windowed sections of the original audio.
The parameters of these transforms can be adjusted using the Window
display properties:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The size of the window can be adjusted using the Window Size
  property.  This value is critical, as it directly controls the
  time-frequency discriminative ability of the resulting spectrogram.
  Smaller values will give a finer resolution in time; larger values
  will give a finer resolution in frequency.

</li><p><li>The overlap between consecutive windows can be adjusted
using the Window Overlap property, which determines by what proportion
of the window size the processing frames will overlap.  Using a larger
overlap will help to compensate for the reduced time
resolution of a large window size.</li>

<p><li>The length of the Fourier transform can be extended beyond the
window size using the Oversampling property, which applies
zero-padding in the time domain to oversample the frequency-domain
signal. The default setting of 1x simply means that the Fourier
transform length and window length are the same. The settings 2x, 4x,
and 8x cause the contents of the window to be padded with zeros to the
given multiple of the window length before applying the
transform. This increases the visual smoothness of the spectrogram and
the precision with which frequency content is shown, but unlike
changing the window size, it has no effect on time-frequency
discriminative ability (such as the ability to separate frequency
components in a mix). Do not mistake the increased visual resolution
for higher-resolution frequency analysis.</li>
    
<p><li><img class="right-wider"
src="images/params-windowpreference.png"/>The shape of the window
applied to each section of audio data is not adjustable from the
spectrogram properties, but can be adjusted globally in the <a
href="#preferences">application preferences</a>.  The available shaped
windows are Hamming, Hann (also known as Hanning), Blackman,
Blackman-Harris and Nuttall (cosine-based windows); Gaussian, Parzen,
triangular and un-windowed (rectangular). The Hann window is the
default and should be appropriate for most purposes.

</li>
</ul>

<p>The scale used for the Y axis of the spectrogram can be adjusted
using the Bins properties. </p>

<ul><p><li>The Bin Display property controls the frequency bins that are
  actually shown and how they are drawn.  If set to Peak Bins, only
  those bins containing higher values than both of their frequency
  neighbours in the same time frame will be drawn.  If set to Frequencies,
  each peak's bin will be drawn with a single line at a position that
  corresponds to an estimate of the actual frequency present within the 
  bin, rather than the theoretical frequency range of the bin.  This
  instantaneous frequency estimate is arrived at by comparing the
  theoretical phase difference between consecutive time frames at the
  nominal bin frequency with the measured phase difference.

</li><p><li>The Frequency Scale property controls whether the Y axis
is proportional to frequency, or proportional to the log of the
frequency (and thus linearly proportional to musical pitch).  In the
latter case the spectrogram layer will use a stylised piano keyboard
as its vertical scale, with the C in each octave shaded in grey.
</li></ul>

<a name="spectrogramharmonic"></a><p><img
style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em;padding-bottom:0.5em"
src="images/harmonic-cursor.png"/>If you switch to the <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/measure.svg"/> measure tool and move the mouse over
the spectrogram, it will show the "harmonic cursor" (see right).  This
is a vertical line with tick marks at the frequencies of the second
harmonic, third harmonic and so on of the frequency that the mouse is
currently pointing at.  These frequencies are simple multiples of the
fundamental, so they will be equally spaced if the frequency scale is
linear, or will get closer together as they go up if the frequency
scale is logarithmic.  See <a href="#measurements">Measurements</a>
for other uses of the Measure tool.</p>

<p>When selecting an area of time in a spectrogram layer, the selection
 will snap to the spectrogram's processing time frames.  Hold the Shift
 key at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<a name="defaultspectrograms"></a><h4>6.3.1 &nbsp;Initial Spectrogram Properties</h4>

<p>The Sonic Visualiser pane and layer menus contain options to add
three kinds of spectrogram.  These are all the same type of layer, but
starting with different display properties.</p>

<a name="fullrangespectrogram"></a><h5>Spectrogram</h5>

<p>The plain spectrogram option creates a spectrogram that displays
the full frequency range up to half of the audio file's sampling rate,
with the vertical Frequency Scale set Linear, with Colour Scale set to
dBV, and using a fairly gentle green colour scheme by default,
although this can be changed in the application preferences.</p>

<p>This is a general overview of the content of the file, in
which background noise and overall equalisation trends may be fairly
evident but individual musical features are not usually easy to make out.</p>

<a name="melodicspectrogram"></a><h5>Melodic Range Spectrogram</h5>

<p>The melodic range spectrogram aims to make it easier to discern
individual musically meaningful features.</p>

<p>It shows by default a frequency range from approx 40Hz to 1.5KHz,
covering around 5.5 octaves that most usually contain melodic content.
The FFT windows are fairly large for better frequency resolution, and
heavily overlapped.  The vertical Frequency Scale is logarithmic in
frequency, and therefore linear in perceived musical pitch.  The
Colour Scale is Linear, making noise and lower-level content invisible
but making it easier to pick out salient musical events, and a crisp
colour scheme is used by default, although this can be changed in the
application preferences.</p>

<a name="peakfreqspectrogram"></a><h5>Peak Frequency Spectrogram</h5>

<p>The peak frequency spectrogram is similar to the melodic range
spectrogram, but it aims to make it possible to pick out precise
frequency content in the material, within certain limitations.</p>

<p>Its Bin Display is set to Frequencies, so that it displays only
those bins that are stronger then their neighbouring frequency bins,
and for each bin it calculates an estimated frequency using phase
unwrapping on the assumption that a stable frequency is present.  This
frequency is then displayed using a short horizontal line, rather than
colouring the whole bin as a block.  In good conditions this may
produce a fairly accurate estimate of the actual frequency of an
individual tone.</p>

<a name="spectrum"></a><h3 style="clear:right">6.4 &nbsp;Spectrum</h3>

<p>The spectrum layer shows a frequency analysis of the audio at a given point in time, like a vertical slice through a <a href="#spectrogram">spectrogram layer</a>.

<p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/pane-spectrum.png"/><br><i>A spectrum layer.</i></div></p>

<p>In contrast to almost all of the other layer types, the x axis of a
spectrum layer does not measure time.  Instead, the spectrum's x axis
corresponds to frequency, with lower frequencies to the left and
higher to the right.  The spectrum animates appropriately to match the
movement of time during playback and navigation, instead of scrolling.
(In this respect it is closely related to the <a href="#slice">slice
layer</a>, which can display a similar slice through a <a
href="#colour3dplot">colour 3D plot</a>.)</p>

<p>The y axis of a spectrum plot shows the value of each frequency
bin, corresponding to the colour scale of the spectrogram.</p>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/params-spectrum.png"/>You can
adjust the window size, overlap, and oversampling level (corresponding
to zero-padding the time-domain signal for a longer FFT) using the
Window properties, just as in the spectrogram; and you can select the
y axis scale (linear or dB), gain and normalisation using the Scale
properties.</p>

<p>The type of plot used to show the spectrum can be adjusted using the Plot Type property:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lines: The start points of the bins will be connected with straight lines.</li><p>
<li>Steps: Each bin will be drawn with a single horizontal line showing the full width of the bin's frequency coverage.</li><p>
<li>Blocks: Each bin will be drawn with an unfilled rectangular block.</li><p>
<li>Colours: Each bin will be drawn with a coloured rectangular block whose colour is based on the same colour mapping scheme as used in the spectrogram.<br>If this option is selected, the Colour property may be used to select between the available colour maps, instead of showing single colours only.</li><p>
</ul>

<p>If the Show Peak Frequencies <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/show-peaks.svg"/> property is set, a vertical line
will be drawn through the estimated frequency of each spectral
peak. If you move the mouse pointer over one of these lines, the
estimated frequency will be shown. The frequency is calculated based
on phase information on the assumption that a stable frequency is
present; this is the same mechanism as used for
the <a href="#peakfreqspectrogram">Peak Frequency Spectrogram</a>.</p>

<p>The horizontal extent of each bin depends on the Plot X Scale
property, which selects the mapping between frequency and x coordinate
for the plot.</p>

<p>If you switch to the <img class="icon" src="images/icons/measure.svg"/> measure
tool and move the mouse over the spectrum, it will show a "harmonic
cursor" like that in the <a
href="#spectrogramharmonic">spectrogram</a>.  See <a
href="#measurements">Measurements</a> for other uses of the Measure
tool.</p>

<a name="timeinstants"></a><h3>6.5 &nbsp;Time Instants</h3>

<p>The time instants layer shows an editable sequence of points in time
 (instants), with each point displayed as a vertical bar across the
 full height of the layer.  Each instant may have a label, which will
 be displayed near the top of the instant.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/pane-timeinstants.png"/><br><i>A time instants layer.</i></div></p>

<p>Instants can be added by clicking with the draw tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/draw.svg"/>, and edited by
 dragging with the edit tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/>.  You can also
 double-click on an instant with the edit or navigate tool
 <img class="icon" src="images/icons/navigate.svg"/>to open an edit dialog in which you can change
 its label and finely adjust its timing.</p>

<p>When selecting an area of time in a time instants layer, the
 selection will snap to the nearest instants on the layer (if any).
 Hold the Shift key at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<p>When a time instants layer is active, the fast-forward and rewind
 buttons can be used to jump the playback position to the nearest
 instant in either direction.</p>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/params-timeinstants.png"/></p>

<p>The Plot Type display property can be used to select between Instants
 display, in which each instant is shown with a single vertical bar,
 and Segmentation display, in which the spaces between instants are
 coloured in alternating shades.</p>

<p>A time instants layer has a fundamental resolution, as a number of
 audio sample frames.  Instants may only occur at multiples of this
 resolution, and are displayed using bars of a width corresponding to
 this resolution.  The default resolution is 1 audio sample frame and
 this cannot currently be changed for any given layer, although layers
 generated by certain plugin transformations may have different
 resolutions.</p>

<a name="timevalues"></a><h3>6.6 &nbsp;Time Values</h3>

<p>The time values layer shows an editable sequence of points in time,
 where each point has a value that determines its position on the Y
 axis.  Each point may also have a label.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/pane-timevalue.png"/><br><i>A time values layer, with curve plot type.</i></div></p>

<p>Points can be added by clicking with the draw tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/draw.svg"/>, and edited by
 dragging with the edit tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/>.  You can also double-click on a point
 with the edit or navigate tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/navigate.svg"/> to open an edit dialog in which you can
 change its label and finely adjust its timing and value.</p>

<p>When selecting an area of time in a time values layer, the selection
 will snap to the nearest instants on the layer (if any).  Hold the
 Shift key at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<p>When a time values layer is active, the fast-forward and rewind
 buttons can be used to jump the playback position to the nearest
 point in either direction.</p>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/params-timevalue.png"/></p>

<p>The Plot Type display property can be used to adjust the display of
 points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Points: Each point will be displayed as a rectangle of width
  corresponding to the layer's time resolution.  The points will not
  be connected.

</li><p><li>Stems: Each point will be displayed as a rectangle of width
  corresponding to the layer's time resolution.  Each point will be
  connected to the zero value on the Y axis by a vertical line.

</li><p><li>Connected Points: Each point will be displayed as a rectangle of width
  corresponding to the layer's time resolution.  Each point will be
  connected to the next with a straight line.

</li><p><li>Lines: The points themselves will not be drawn explicitly; instead
  a straight line segment will be drawn between the centres of consecutive
  points, resulting in a line graph.

</li><p><li>Curve: The centres of consecutive points will be used as the control
  points of a series of cubic splines, resulting in a smooth curve.  Note
  that the curve will not pass through the actual point locations at
  local peak high and low values.

</li><p><li>Segmentation: The spaces between the times of each pair of consecutive
  points will be shaded in a colour corresponding to the value of the point
      at the start of the space.

</li><p><li>Discrete Curves: Intended for displaying curve data with
gaps in it. The points are connected with a smooth curve, but whenever
two consecutive (non-zero) values have a gap between them of more than
double the model resolution, the curve will be interrupted between
those points.

    </li>

      
</ul>
<p>A time values layer may have a unit for the scale on the Y axis.
 If two layers with the same unit appear on the same pane, they will by
 default have vertical scales aligned with each other.  This behaviour
 can be adjusted using the Vertical Scale display property.</p>

<p>If Vertical Scale is set to Linear or Log Scale, the scale will cover
 the range of values (or logs of values) present in the layer; if set
 to "+/-1", it will cover the range from -1 to +1 and points with
 values outside that range will be omitted.</p>

<p>If the Vertical Scale for a layer is set to anything other than
 Auto-Align, then any other layers in the same pane that have the same
 unit and that have Vertical Scale set to Auto-Align will align
 themselves to match it.</p>

<p>You can change the scale unit for a layer by selecting from, or editing
 the value in, the Scale Units property combo-box.</p>

<p>A time values layer has a fundamental resolution, as a number of audio
 sample frames.  Points may only occur at times that are multiples of
 this resolution, and they may be displayed using boxes of a width
 corresponding to this resolution.  The default resolution is 1 audio
 sample frame and this cannot currently be changed for any given layer,
 although layers generated by certain plugin transformations may have
 different resolutions.</p>

<a name="notes"></a><h3>6.7 &nbsp;Notes</h3>

<p>The notes layer shows an editable sequence of notes, where each note
 has a start time, a duration, and a value that determines its position
 on the Y axis.  Each note may also have a label.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/pane-notes.png"/><br><i>A note layer.</i></div></p>

<p>Notes can be added by clicking and dragging with the draw tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/draw.svg"/>, and
 edited by dragging with the edit tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/>.  You can also double-click on a
 note with the edit or navigate tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/navigate.svg"/> to open an edit dialog in which
 you can change its label and finely adjust its timing and value.</p>

<p>When selecting an area of time in a notes layer, the selection will
 snap to the start times of the nearest notes on the layer (if any).
 Hold the Shift key at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<p>A notes layer may have a unit for the scale on the Y axis.
 If two layers with the same unit appear on the same pane, they will by
 default have vertical scales aligned with each other.  This behaviour
 can be adjusted using the Vertical Scale display property.</p>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/params-notes.png"/></p>

<p>If Vertical Scale is set to Linear or Log Scale, the scale will cover
 the range of values (or logs of values) present in the layer; if set
 to "MIDI Note Range", it will cover the range from MIDI notes 0 to 127
 and values outside that range will be omitted.</p>

<p>If the Vertical Scale for a layer is set to anything other than
 Auto-Align, then any other layers in the same pane that have the same
 unit and that have Vertical Scale set to Auto-Align will align
 themselves to match it.</p>

<p>You can change the scale unit for a layer by selecting from, or
 editing the value in, the Pitch Units property combo-box.  However, if
 the scale unit is anything other than "Hz", the layer will assume that
 the values correspond to MIDI pitch and will convert them to Hz when
 calculating display and alignment.</p>

<p>A notes layer has a fundamental resolution, as a number of audio
 sample frames.  Notes may only occur at times that are multiples of
 this resolution.  The default resolution is 1 audio sample frame and
 this cannot currently be changed for any given layer, although layers
 generated by certain plugin transformations may have different
 resolutions.</p>

<a name="regions"></a><h3>6.8 &nbsp;Regions</h3>

<p>The regions layer shows an editable sequence of regions spanning
durations in time.  Each region has a value, which by default
determines its position on the Y axis, and a duration.  A region may
also have a label.  A regions layer is used (for example) to display
the result features returned by a plugin transform that associates a
duration with each of its values.</p>

<p>Regions can be added by clicking with the draw tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/draw.svg"/>, and moved by
 dragging with the edit tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/>.  You can also double-click on a region
 with the edit or navigate tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/navigate.svg"/> to open an edit dialog.  (You may need
 to click near the left edge of the region for an edit to take
 effect.)</p>

<p>When selecting a region of time in a region layer, the selection will
 snap to the nearest region start.  Hold the Shift key
 at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<a name="boxes"></a><h3>6.9 &nbsp;Boxes</h3>

<p>The boxes layer shows a set of rectangular areas. A box encloses a
duration in time for a given y-axis range, and you can also add a text
label to each box.</p>

<p><img class="right-wider" src="images/pane-boxes.png"/>The boxes
layer is intended to be superimposed on another layer that has a
suitable vertical scale &mdash; such as a spectrogram or time-values
layer. The image to the right
  shows a boxes layer superimposed on a spectrogram layer.</p>

<p>Provided that the vertical scale setting of the boxes layer is set
to Auto-Align, and that it has the correct scale unit to match the
layer underneath (such as Hz for a spectrogram), the boxes should
correctly indicate the y-axis values for the layer underneath. These
are the default settings when you first add a boxes layer on top of an
existing layer with a suitable vertical scale.</p>

<p>Boxes can be added by dragging with the draw tool <img class="icon"
 src="images/icons/draw.svg"/>, and moved by dragging with the edit
 tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/>.  You can also
 double-click on a box with the edit or navigate tool
 <img class="icon" src="images/icons/navigate.svg"/> to open an edit
 dialog and to label the box.</p>

<p>Note that the boxes layer is not the same as
<a href="#measurements">measurement</a> rectangles, which can be
added to any layer using the Measure tool. Measurements rectangles are
really intended for interactive exploration of a space, while the
boxes layer is intended for persistent annotations that may be saved,
exported, or edited later in the session.</p>

<a name="text"></a><h3>6.10 &nbsp;Text</h3>

<p>The text layer shows text annotation labels.  Each label is fixed to a
 particular position in time, and appears at a particular height on the
 layer.  The text layer is intended for informal or descriptive
 annotations that are not attached to other sorts of features (as the
 other editable layer types allow their points to have labels as well).</p>

<p>Labels can be added by clicking with the draw tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/draw.svg"/>, and moved by
 dragging with the edit tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/>.  You can also double-click on a label
 with the edit or navigate tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/navigate.svg"/> to open an edit dialog.  (You may need
 to click at the top-left corner of the text label for an edit to take
 effect.)</p>

<p>When selecting a region of time in a text layer, the selection will
 snap to the nearest label on the layer (if any).  Hold the Shift key
 at the start of selection to defeat this.</p>

<a name="images"></a><h3>6.11 &nbsp;Images</h3>

<p>The images layer shows images with optional labels.  These images
are drawn from image files at a disk or network location; only the
image location is stored in the session, not the whole image, so you
should be careful to make sure images are stored at an accessible location or transmitted with your session files as appropriate.</p>

<p>Images in a layer are fixed to a particular position in time under
your control, but their Y coordinate on the pane is based entirely on
their height and cannot be changed.</p>

<p>Images can be added by clicking with the draw tool <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/draw.svg"/>, and moved by dragging with the edit
tool <img class="icon" src="images/icons/move.svg"/>.  You can also double-click on
an image with the edit or navigate tool <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/navigate.svg"/> to open an edit dialog from which
you can set the label or change the image being displayed.</p>

<a name="colour3dplot"></a><h3>6.12 &nbsp;Colour 3D Plot</h3>

<p>The colour 3D plot layer displays a three-dimensional data set in a
 grid.</p>

<p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/pane-colour3dplot.png"/><br><i>A colour 3D plot layer.</i></div></p>

<p>It is used for data sets which have a discrete time axis, a set of
bins at each time position, and a value in each bin.  (In this respect
it resembles the <a href="#spectrogram">spectrogram</a>, except that the
spectrogram also knows about frequencies, window sizes and so on.)
The grid x and y coordinates correspond to the time and bin
respectively, and each grid square is coloured according to the value
in the corresponding bin.</p>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/params-colour3dplot.png"/>You
can change the colour map used for the value scale using the Colour
property; adjust whether the colour is mapped to a linear or
logarithmic scale using the Scale property; and also choose to
normalise the individual columns of the plot. See
the <a href="#spectrogram">Spectrogram</a> layer for details of the
different normalisation options.</p>

<p>The colour 3D plot layer is not editable.  For this reason, you
cannot add an empty colour 3D plot layer using the Layer menu, because
you would then be unable to do anything with it.  These layers only
appear when a <a href="#plugins">transform</a> whose output is
appropriate for grid display is applied, or when <a
href="#layerimport">importing</a> certain types of annotation
data.</p>

<a name="slice"></a><h4>6.12.1 &nbsp;Slices</h4>

<p>A slice layer shows an instantaneous graph of the values present
along the Y axis of a colour 3D plot layer, at the moment
corresponding to the current centre frame.  A slice is to a colour 3D
plot as a <a href="#spectrum">spectrum</a> is to a <a
href="#spectrogram">spectrogram</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a colour 3D plot layer present in Sonic Visualiser, you
can add a slice layer for it using the Add Slice of Layer option in
the Layer menu.</p>

<a name="plugins"></a><h2>7 &nbsp;Transforms and Plugins</h2>

<a name="transform"></a><h3 class="first">7.1 &nbsp;The Transform Menu</h3>

<p>The Transform menu contains all of the available means of
generating new layers with new data in them, using various kinds of
binary plugin.  If the Transform menu is empty, then you need to get
some plugins!</p>

<p>Several types of plugin-based transform are available.</p>

<a name="vampplugins"></a><h3>7.2 &nbsp;Analysis Plugins</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser can generate layers using audio analysis and
feature extraction plugins, which may be provided by third party
developers or institutions.  The native plugin format is called Vamp
(see <a
href="http://www.vamp-plugins.org"><code>http://www.vamp-plugins.org</code></a>).
Vamp plugins take audio inputs and can generate outputs suitable for
display in any of Sonic Visualiser's standard types of layer.</p>

<p>If you have any Vamp plugins installed, Sonic Visualiser will show
them in the Analysis section of the Transform menu.  This section
contains three menus, sorting the available plugin outputs according
to plugin category, plugin name, or the maker of the plugin.  Category
information is obtained from an optional <code>.cat</code> file
associated with each plugin library; Vamp plugins that lack categories
will appear in an Unclassified section.  (Advanced users may set up
their own category hierarchy by making and installing their own
<code>.cat</code> files: the file format is a simple textual one
easily made by copy-paste and editing existing files.)</p>

<p>Selecting an analysis plugin output will generate a new layer in
the current pane, containing the output produced by that plugin from
the main audio waveform.  If the plugin has any configurable
parameters, you will be shown a configuration dialog before the plugin
is run.  If you have more than one audio file or generated audio
waveform present in Sonic Visualiser, this dialog will also allow you
to select which of them will be used as the input to the plugin.</p>

<p>The processing step and block sizes for Vamp plugins are set by
negotiation with the plugin, with a default of 1024 audio sample
frames in cases where the plugin does not have a preference.  You can
change these sizes, and also adjust the behaviour of plugins that
operate on single-channel audio when using a multi-channel audio file,
from the Advanced options section of the plugin's configuration
dialog.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.vamp-plugins.org/download.html">Vamp
plugin download page</a> to find out about some of the available Vamp
plugins and how to install them.  See the <a
href="http://www.vamp-plugins.org/develop.html">Vamp API
documentation</a> for details of the plugin format and how to develop
new Vamp plugins.</p>

<a name="ladspaplugins"></a><h3>7.3 &nbsp;Effects Plugins</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser also supports effects plugins in the <a
href="http://www.ladspa.org/">LADSPA</a> and <a
href="http://dssi.sourceforge.net/">DSSI</a> formats.  These are
originally Linux plugin formats, but are portable to other
platforms as well, and many LADSPA effects in particular are available
for most popular platforms.</p>

<p>Effects plugins can be used to generate new layers in more than one
way, and so if you have any installed, you will see up to three
corresponding sections in the Transform menu.</p>

<a name="effects"></a><h4>7.3.1 &nbsp;Effects</h4>

<p>The Effects section of the Transform menu lists plugins that take
audio as input and convert it to audio output.  This is the most usual mode
of operation for an effects plugin.</p>

<p>Selecting an effects plugin will generate a new layer in the
current pane, containing the new audio waveform produced by that
plugin.  If the plugin has any configurable parameters, you will be
shown a configuration dialog before the plugin is run.  If you have
more than one audio file or generated audio waveform present in Sonic
Visualiser, this dialog will also allow you to select which of them
will be used as the input to the plugin.</p>

<p>The processing block size for effects plugins defaults to 1024 audio
sample frames.  You can change this, and also adjust the behaviour of
plugins that operate on single-channel audio when using a
multi-channel audio file, from the Advanced options section of the
plugin's configuration dialog.</p>

<a name="effectsdata"></a><h4>7.3.2 &nbsp;Effects Data</h4>

<p>Sonic Visualiser can also generate layers from "control-rate"
outputs of effects plugins.  These are referred to as Effects Data.</p>

<p>For example, a compressor plugin may (in addition to its audio
outputs) have a control-rate output that returns the measured dB level
of the audio.  Sonic Visualiser can use this output to create a new <a
href="#timevalues">time values</a> layer, by running the compressor
and effectively discarding its audio output, keeping only the
control-rate output.  Other plugins may have other control-rate
outputs with different uses.</p>

<p>If you have any plugins installed that can be used in this way,
they will appear in the Effects Data section of the Transform menu.
In most cases, these will be the control-rate outputs of plugins whose
audio outputs also appear under Effects.  Some plugins intended only
for measurement use may have only control-rate outputs and no audio
outputs; such a plugin will only appear under Effects Data and not
under Effects.</p>

<p>Selecting an effects plugin output from the Effects Data section
will generate a new layer in the current pane, containing a time value
layer showing the output produced by that plugin.  If the plugin has
any configurable parameters, you will be shown a configuration dialog
before the plugin is run.  If you have more than one audio file or
generated audio waveform present in Sonic Visualiser, this dialog will
also allow you to select which of them will be used as the input to
the plugin.</p>

<p>The processing block size for effects plugins defaults to 1024 audio
sample frames.  You can change this, and also adjust the behaviour of
plugins that operate on single-channel audio when using a
multi-channel audio file, from the Advanced options section of the
plugin's configuration dialog.</p>

<a name="generators"></a><h4>7.3.3 &nbsp;Generators</h4>

<p>Finally, some "effects" plugins have only audio outputs, and no
inputs.  They generate new audio data usually based on various
controlling parameters, and are referred to as Generators.  Useful
examples include sine-wave tone generators, white and pink noise
generators and so on.  These can be handy for generating comparative
signals or signals to test processing algorithms for plugin
development purposes.</p>

<p>Sonic Visualiser does not support generating new layers from what
are traditionally known as instrument or synth plugins, which create
audio output from "note event" inputs.  It also does not support
varying the control parameters of a generator plugin during operation.
Finally, a current limitation is that generators can only be used to
produce an additional waveform when you already have at least one
audio file present &mdash; you cannot use a generator to create the
only audio file in a previously empty Sonic Visualiser session.</p>

<p>If you have any effects plugins installed that Sonic Visualiser can
use in this way, they will appear in the Generators section of the
Transform menu.</p>

<p>Selecting a plugin output from the Generators section will generate
a new layer in the current pane, containing the new audio waveform
produced by that plugin.  If the plugin has any configurable
parameters, you will be shown a configuration dialog before the plugin
is run.</p>

<p>The processing block size for effects plugins defaults to 1024
audio sample frames.  You can change this from the Advanced options
section of the plugin's configuration dialog.</p>

<a name="findtransform"></a><h3>7.4 &nbsp;Find a Transform</h3>

<p>The "Find a Transform" function, available at the bottom of the
Transform menu, calls up a transform plugin search facility. This
allows you to quickly search the names and descriptions of available
plugins in order to find the transform you desire, and run it if it is
installed.</p>

<p>Just type some text into the text field at the top of the Find a
Transform window, and Sonic Visualiser will search as you type.
Provided an internet connection is available, the search should cover
all Vamp plugins whose descriptions have been encoded using the <a
href="http://omras2.org/VampOntology">Vamp plugin ontology</a>, made
available on the semantic web, and registered with the Vamp plugins
website.  The search will also cover the name and description data
provided by all installed Vamp audio feature extraction plugins and
LADSPA audio effects.</p>

<p>Transforms that were found using information provided by plugins
that are already installed on the system may be run directly from this
window: just double-click on a result in the list in order to run it
as a transform.</p>

<p>Transforms that were found using semantic web descriptions of
plugins that are not currently installed will be labelled "(not
installed)".  Depending on the semantic web data available, there may
be a link provided to an information or installation page for these
plugins.  Sonic Visualiser does not currently provide an automatic
plugin installation method.</p>

<a name="measurements"></a><h2>8 &nbsp;Measurements</h2>

<p><img style="float:right;max-width:50%;padding-left:1em;padding-bottom:0.5em"
src="images/measurement.png"/>The measure tool <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/measure.svg"/> enables you to obtain measurements in
scale units (such as time in the X coordinate, or whatever the Y
coordinate of the current layer represents) corresponding to certain
pixel positions.  To measure an area, click and drag a rectangle
covering it, using the left mouse button with the measure tool
selected.</p>

<p>An example is shown above: the dragged rectangle
(in green) covers an area corresponding to 1.26 seconds in the X axis,
and 32.9 Hz (9 semitones minus 28 cents, in this context) in the Y
axis.</p>

<p>It's important to note that the measurements shown in this way are
based entirely on the pixel coordinates of the measurement rectangle,
not on properties of the data being displayed.  For example, in the
spectrogram shown above the values are not snapped to bin boundaries
in either axis.</p>

<p>You can add any number of measurement rectangles to a layer.  They
are saved and restored with the session file, but they are only
displayed while the measure tool is selected, and are only highlighted
and labelled when the mouse pointer is inside the rectangle.</p>

<p>To remove a measurement rectangle, hover the mouse pointer inside
it (so that it is highlighted) and press the Delete key.  You can also
Undo the addition of measurement rectangles, just like other
editing operations.</p>

<a name="automeasurement"></a><h3 class="first">8.1. Automatic measurement in the spectrogram</h3>

<p>The spectrogram layer has a further extension to the use of the
measure tool.  With the measure tool selected, you can double-click on
a feature that is visible in the spectrogram, and a measurement
rectangle will be automatically drawn around that feature.</p>

<p>The area enclosed by the rectangle is based on the extent of
similarly-coloured pixels surrounding the click position: it is
entirely graphical, involving no audio analysis, and so depends on the
gain and colour scheme in use in the spectrogram.  The accuracy and
usefulness of this capability obviously vary enormously depending on
the data being displayed.</p>

<a name="audioplayback"></a><h2>9 &nbsp;Audio Playback and Recording</h2>

<a name="audioplaybackplayback"></a><h3 class="first">9.1 &nbsp;Playback</h3>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/transport.png">Playback in
Sonic Visualiser is controlled using the transport controls in the
toolbar.</p>

<p>Use the &nbsp;<img class="icon"
src="images/icons/playpause.svg">&nbsp; Play / Pause button, or press
the Space key, to start and stop playback.</p>

<p>Use <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/rewind-start.svg"> Rewind to Start and <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/ffwd-end.svg"> Fast Forward to End to jump to either
end of the audio file.</p>

<p>Use <img class="icon" src="images/icons/rewind.svg"> Rewind and <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/ffwd.svg"> Fast Forward to jump to the nearest item
in the appropriate direction in the current layer, if it is a <a
href="#timeinstants">time instants</a> or <a href="#timevalue">time
value</a> layer, or to the nearest numbered unit in the time ruler for
the pane otherwise.</p>

<p>You can also jump about during playback by dragging a pane using
the <img class="icon" src="images/icons/navigate.svg"> navigate tool;
by double-clicking with the navigate tool at any point in any pane; or
by double-clicking on the small representation of the audio file at
the bottom of Sonic Visualiser's main window.</p>

<p>There are four further playback controls on the toolbar. If the
<img class="icon" src="images/icons/playselection.svg"/> Play
Selection toggle button is depressed and there is a selection active,
then when you ask to Play, Sonic Visualiser will play only the
selected extent.  It is possible to have more than one separate extent
selected (see <a href="#selection">Selection</a>); playback will jump
seamlessly from the end of one selected extent to the start of the
next if this is the case.</p>

<p>If the <img class="icon" src="images/icons/playloop.svg"/> Play Loop toggle
button is depressed, then playback will jump back to the start of the
audio file or selection when it reaches the end.</p>

<p>If the <img class="icon" src="images/icons/solo.svg"/> Play Solo toggle button
is depressed, then only audio data from the currently active pane will
be played.</p>

<p>If the <img class="icon" src="images/icons/align.svg"/> Align File Timelines
button is depressed, then playback pointers in panes other than the
current one will be shown at times that correspond to the same
location in their audio material as that being played in the current
pane, where possible, instead of being shown at the same time in
seconds as the current pane.  Using Align File Timelines will
automatically enable Solo.  See <a href="#alignment">Time
Alignment</a>.</p>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/params-playback.png">At the
bottom-right of the main window, you can see two controls for playback
speed and volume level/pan. The dial control can be used to speed up
or slow down playback: you can adjust playback speed from one-tenth to
ten times the original speed without affecting its pitch, although the
sound quality will suffer. The level/pan button shows both volume
level and overall stereo balance and can be used to adjust both, in
the same manner as described for the layer playback parameters below.

<a name="sonification"></a><h3>9.2 &nbsp;Sonification</h3>

<p>Besides playback of the source audio files, Sonic Visualiser can
also play some of the editable layers using tapping or note
sounds. Time instants, note layers, and curve layers with Hz units can
be played in this way. (Time instants and note layers have playback
switched on by default, but for curves you need to enable it.)</p>

<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/params-layerplayback.png">
This behaviour, as well as the levels of individual audio sources, can
be adjusted in the playback section of the layer properties for each
layer. An example for a Notes layer is shown to the right, where the
three buttons on the left control the playback settings.</p>

<p><img style="float:left; max-width: 10%; padding-right: 1em"
src="images/params-layerplayback-popup.png">The leftmost "matrix"
button shows the current playback level (or volume) and pan or balance
(stereo placement) for this layer. Click this control to pop up a
larger version on which you can set the level and pan by clicking and
dragging the level bar. To switch playback on and off completely,
toggle the "loudspeaker" <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/speaker.svg"/> button.</p>

<p>For some layers, you can set a particular sound sample to be used
in playback. Click the rightmost "faders" button to bring up a dialog
in which you can select the playback sound sample and any related
parameters.</p>

<a name="audiorecording"></a><h3>9.3 &nbsp;Recording</h3>

<p>Use the Record button <img class="icon"
src="images/icons/record.svg"> to start recording a new audio file
from the microphone or another input. You can select the record
source, from the system's available audio inputs, in Sonic
Visualiser's Preferences. Press Record again, or the Space key, to
stop recording.</p>

<p>Recorded audio files are saved in a folder beneath your home
directory, and remain there after Sonic Visualiser exits: closing the
session does not delete them. Go to File &rarr; Browse Recorded And
Converted Audio to open the recorded audio folder in your system's
file explorer window.</p>

<a name="microphonepermission"></a><h4>9.3.1 &nbsp;Permission to use the microphone (macOS only)</h4>

<p>On macOS 10.14 Mojave or newer, the first time you ask to record
from the built-in microphone, a system dialog box will appear asking
for permission to use the microphone. You must agree to this, or else
the recording will be silent. The operating system remembers your
reply, and will not ask you again, even on subsequent runs of Sonic
Visualiser. If you need to change this later, refer to the Privacy
controls in your System Preferences.
  
<a name="tapping"></a><h2>10 &nbsp;Annotation by Tapping</h2>

<p>A convenient way to add points to a <a href="#timeinstants">time
instants</a> layer is by "tapping" during playback.</p>

<a name="tapkeyboard"></a><h3>10.1 &nbsp;Tapping on the PC Keyboard</h3>

<p>The simplest way to tap in new points is to <a
href="#audioplayback">play the audio</a> and, at each moment where you
want a point to be added, tap either the Enter key on the numeric
keypad (if you have one), or the semicolon (";") key on the keyboard.</p>

<p>If a time instants layer is active, a point will be added to it at the
time at which you tapped; if no time instants layer is active, a new
one will be created and the point added to that.</p>

<p>If you want to add points to a different sort of layer, such as a
time values layer, you can <a href="#cutandpaste">Cut and Paste</a> to
transfer the points to your target layer with values calculated in a
variety of different ways, for example according to the distances
between the points.</p>

<a name="tapmidi"></a><h3>10.2 &nbsp;Tapping with MIDI</h3>

<p>If you have a MIDI keyboard or similar MIDI input device attached,
you can use it to tap instants into Sonic Visualiser &mdash; and also
to record notes into a note layer.  Tapping using a MIDI keyboard will
normally give better timing resolution and accuracy than doing so
using the PC keyboard.</p>

<p>To tap instants using a MIDI keyboard, <a
href="#audioplayback">play the audio</a> and, at each moment where you
want a point to be added, tap a key on the MIDI keyboard. If a time
instants layer is active, a point will be added to it at the time at
which you tapped; if no time instants layer is active, a new one will
be created and the point added to that.</p>

<p>If you instead have a <a href="#timevalue">time values layer</a>
active, Sonic Visualiser will add new points to that layer as you tap.
The points will have values based on the pitch class (0-11, where 0 is
C) of the tapped MIDI note.</p>

<p>If you have a <a href="#notes">notes layer</a> active, Sonic
Visualiser will record MIDI notes into the layer as you play them.</p>

<p>Sonic Visualiser does not yet provide any way to select a MIDI
device for use as the input, in the case where you have more than one.
The default system device is always used.</p>

<a name="alignment"></a><h2>11 &nbsp;Time Alignment</h2>

<p>Sonic Visualiser provides support for automatically aligning audio
file timelines to one another.  This is useful when dealing with
multiple audio files that represent the same source material, such as
multiple performances of the same work or multiple "takes" of a
recording.</p>

<p>For this feature to be enabled, the MATCH Vamp plugin &mdash; a
Vamp plugin implementation of Simon Dixon's MATCH algorithm for audio
alignment &mdash; must be installed and available.  See <a
href="http://www.vamp-plugins.org/download.html">the Vamp plugins
download page</a> for details on how to obtain and install this
plugin, and the <a
href="http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/people/simond/match/index.html">MATCH
home page</a> for more background and information about the methods
used.  If the plugin is found to be installed when Sonic Visualiser
starts, the <img class="icon" src="images/icons/align.svg"/> Align File Timelines
toggle button will appear in the toolbar and the alignment feature
will be enabled.</p>

<p>To make use of the alignment feature, import two (or more) audio
files that share some common source material into separate panes and
click the <img class="icon" src="images/icons/align.svg"/> Align File Timelines
button.  Sonic Visualiser will then take some time to calculate an
alignment in time between the files.  The first file to be loaded will
be treated as the reference, against which the other files are
aligned; during alignment you will see a progress bar at the bottom
left of each pane other than the reference.</p>

<p>Once alignment is completed, when you scroll or play through one of
the audio files, Sonic Visualiser will position the other files so as
to align them by source material with the one you are scrolling.  For
example, if one audio file contains a recording at twice the tempo of
the other, you should expect the scrolling and playback pointer motion
in the slower file to happen at twice the speed in terms of pixels,
because the slower file takes up twice as many audio samples for the
same period of the original score as the faster one.  (Although
counter-intuitive when described, this makes sense in use!)</p>

<p>You should also be able to switch from one pane to another during
playback, with playback jumping from the source file to the target
file at the same point relative to the underlying score or source
material.</p>

<p>Selection extents are also subject to alignment between panes; and
if you cut and paste items from one layer to another layer that has a
different underlying audio file, you will be offered the option of
re-aligning the times of the items you are pasting.</p>

<a name="fileimportandexport"></a><h2>12 &nbsp;File Import and Export</h2>

<a name="audioimport"></a><h3 class="first">12.1 &nbsp;Audio File Import</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser can open audio files in a number of formats,
although the exact set of formats depends on the platform and
supporting libraries that it was compiled with.  The builds that we
provide on the official site support MP3, WAV, AIFF, Ogg/Vorbis, and
Opus file import on all platforms, as well as MP4/AAC on both Mac and
Windows, and WMA on Windows only.</p>

<p>To open an audio file, or any other kind of file that Sonic
Visualiser supports (including session and layer files), use File &rarr;
Open... or the Open button <img class="icon" src="images/icons/fileopen.svg"/> on
the toolbar.  You can open more than one audio file at once: if you
already have one open and you want to add another, use File &rarr; Import
More Audio...</p>

<a name="audioexport"></a><h3>12.2 &nbsp;Audio File Export</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser can export the current audio file, or the selected
extent of it, as a WAV file in IEEE floating-point format.  Use File
&rarr; Export Audio File to do this.</p>

<p>If there are multiple separate extents selected, you will be given
the option to export them all spliced into a single audio file, or to
export to a series of audio files distinguished by .1, .2 etc in their
names.

<a
name="audiodata"></a><h3>12.3 &nbsp;Converting Audio and Data Files</h3>

    <p>In addition to loading and saving audio file formats, Sonic
    Visualiser can read audio signals from, and export to,
    comma-separated value (CSV) and similar textual data files. Use
    File &rarr; Convert Audio From Data File... to read audio data
    from a CSV file or similar, and File &rarr; Export Audio To Data
    File... to save audio data into a CSV file. When importing, you
    will be asked to confirm the file column layout, sample range, and
    sampling rate.</p>

    <p>When converting audio from a data file, Sonic Visualiser
    creates an audio file on disc to hold the converted signal. This
    file will be saved in the <code>converted</code> folder within the
    recorded-audio location, and will remain there after Sonic
    Visualiser exits. Use File &rarr; Browse Recorded And Converted
    Audio to review such files.</p>

<a name="layerimport"></a><h3>12.4 &nbsp;Annotation Layer Import</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser can import comma-separated (CSV) or tab-separated
text data files as new annotation layers, whose type will depend on
the format of data in the files and your preferences when importing
the data.  Sonic Visualiser can currently import data to time
instants, time values, and colour 3D plot layers.</p>

<p>To import data from a text file, use the File &rarr; Import Annotation Layer
and specify the proper file type in the import dialog.</p>

<p>You can also use this function to import data from Sonic
Visualiser's own .svl layer file format, which is an XML format; any
type of editable layer may be exported and imported to this
format.</p>

<p>Sonic Visualiser can also import data from RDF documents using the
<a href="http://omras2.org/AudioFeatures">Audio Features ontology</a>.
(An example of an application which produces these documents natively
is the <a href="http://omras2.org/SonicAnnotator">Sonic Annotator</a>
batch audio feature extraction program.)</p>

<p>Finally, you can also import Standard MIDI files as note layers.
Only a single track can be imported at a time.</p>

<a
name="layerexport"></a><h3>12.5 &nbsp;Annotation Layer Export</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser can export layers as comma-separated or
tab-separated text data,
as <a href="http://omras2.org/AudioFeatures">Audio Features ontology
RDF</a> in Turtle syntax, as Standard MIDI files, or as its
own <code>.svl</code> XML format.</p>

<p>To export a layer, ensure that the layer is current, and use File
&rarr; Export Annotation Layer.  The file type will be determined from
the extension you use when naming the file: <code>.csv</code> for
comma-separated files,
<code>.txt</code> or <code>.tsv</code> for tab-separated
files, <code>.svl</code> for Sonic Visualiser layer
files, <code>.ttl</code> for RDF/Turtle files, and
<code>.mid</code> for Standard MIDI files. If your filename has no
extension, CSV will be assumed and a <code>.csv</code> extension will
be added.</p>

<p>Which layer types you can export depends on the file format you are
exporting to:</p>

<ul><li>To Sonic Visualiser layer files and RDF/Turtle: all of the
editable annotation layer types can be exported &mdash; Time Instants, Time
Values, Notes, Regions, Boxes, Text, Images, and Colour 3D Plot.</li>

<p><li>To CSV and similar delimited text formats: all of the above can
be exported, as well as Spectrogram layers, including peak-frequency
spectrograms (even though these are not strictly annotation
layers). The export is always of the raw model data, ignoring
normalisation and gain settings. Peak-frequency spectrograms are
exported as a series of alternating frequency and magnitude columns,
taking into account the threshold setting in the view when determining
which peaks to export.</li>

<p><li>To MIDI files: only note layers can be exported.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Spectrum layers can't be exported.</p>

<p>To export the original audio waveform to a textual data file,
use <a href="#audiodata">Export Audio To Data File</a> instead.</p>
  
<p><img class="right-modest" src="images/layer-export.png"/></p>
<p>
When exporting a layer to a CSV or similar delimited text format, you
will be offered a number of options controlling the details of the
exported file (see image). You can choose the column separator
character, whether to include a header row before the data, and the
presence and format of the timestamp column.</p>

<p>The set of available options depends on the layer type: for
example, sparse layers such as time-value layers must have a timestamp
column, so that option is always set when exporting such layers.</p>

<p>If there is a <a href="#selection">selection</a> currently active,
then when exporting to CSV-like formats or MIDI you will be given the
option to export only the time region within the selection. Note that
in this case the export will consist of those events or columns that
start within the selected area &mdash; events whose duration spans
part of the selection will not be included unless they actually start
inside it.</p>

<p>For the dense layers (Colour 3D Plot and Spectrogram), you will
also have the option of whether to export only those frequency or
value bins that fall within the vertical range of the view, or whether
to export the full height of the layer regardless of the current
vertical zoom setting.</p>

<a
name="imageexport"></a><h3>12.6 &nbsp;Image File Export</h3>

<p>You can use the File &rarr; Export Image File function to export the
current pane as an image file in PNG format.  This exports the full
width of the pane, not just the currently visible area of it, and so
it may create a very large file.</p>

<a
name="remote"></a><h3>12.7 &nbsp;Opening Remote Locations</h3>

<p>Sonic Visualiser can open files obtained by download from remote
HTTP and FTP locations.  Use File &rarr; Open Location to do this,
entering a standard http:// or ftp:// URL into the location dialog.
Full sessions, single audio files, layer files, and even m3u playlist
files may be opened in this way.</p>

<p>If you open a session file from a remote location, Sonic Visualiser
will use the same remote location to search for any audio or other
dependent files that the session refers to and that can not be found
at the literal locations recorded in the session file.</p>

<a
name="templates"></a><h3>12.8 &nbsp;Session Templates</h3>

<p>Once you have a session set up with a useful set of layers and
panes, you can save it as a template and use it with other audio files
in the future.  To do this, use File &rarr; Export Session as Template and
choose a name for the new template.</p>

<p>Templates you have exported will appear in the menu found at File
&rarr; Apply Session Template.  This menu also contains some standard
templates which are bundled with Sonic Visualiser.  Selecting a
template from this menu will replace the current session with the
template you have selected, using the current audio file as its main
model.  You can choose a template to be used every time you open a new
audio file, in the Session Template tab of the Application Preferences.</p>

<p>Exported templates are simply stored as session files with a .svt
prefix, in your local Sonic Visualiser templates directory.  To rename
or delete any of them, use File &rarr; Manage Exported Templates to open
the templates directory in your system file manager.</p>

<a name="unitconverter"></a><h2>14 &nbsp;The Unit Converter</h2>

<p><img class="left-wider"
src="images/unit-converter-frequency.png"></p>The Unit Converter
window, accessible through View &rarr; Show Unit Converter, is a helper
utility for conversions between frequency and simple musical pitch
measurements, and between beat duration and tempo. It has two tabs
containing form fields for conversion: pitch (see left) and tempo
(below).</p>

<p>The pitch converter has fields in which you can enter a fundamental
frequency value, MIDI pitch, or note name; whenever you change the
value in any field, all of the other fields are updated so that the
displayed frequency and displayed pitch match up. (For example, if you
enter 261Hz, the other fields will update to show middle C, with a
small rounding error reflected as an offset in the cents field at the
right.) All conversions simplistically assume 12-tone equal
temperament, so that it makes no difference which key is in effect,
and are carried out relative to the reference tuning frequency and
MIDI octave numbering currently set in the application
preferences.</p>

<p><img class="right-wider" src="images/unit-converter-tempo.png">The
tempo converter has fields in which you can specify a beat period (the
length of time between consecutive beats) in either milliseconds or
audio samples, or a tempo value in either beats per second or beats
per minute (bpm). There is also a sample rate field, which gives the
number of samples per second used for the audio sample timing
field. As with the pitch converter, when you change any value, the
others are updated so that they all show the same effective
tempo. (For example, if you enter 180bpm, the other fields will show 3
beats per second, 333&frac13;ms, and a third of whatever sample rate
has been entered.)</p>

<p style="clear:both"></p>

<a name="preferences"></a><h2>14 &nbsp;Application Preferences</h2>

<p>The Application Preferences window (available through the
Preferences option of the File menu) contains a number of things which
may be adjusted to change the display or calculations carried out by
Sonic Visualiser.</p>

<ul><li>Property box layout: This preference controls how the layer <a
href="#layeredits">display property boxes</a> are arranged on the
right side of the Sonic Visualiser window.  If set to "Show boxes for
all panes" (the default), each pane will have a set of display
property boxes to its right.  If set to "Show box for current pane
only", there will be only one set of property boxes, and each time the
current pane changes, the property boxes will be updated to reflect
that new pane.  This permits the panes to be smaller, because their
sizes are not constrained by the sizes of the property boxes, and
consequently allows you to fit more panes on the screen.</li>

<p><li>Background colour preference (not available on OS/X): This
preference controls whether Sonic Visualiser will start up with a dark
background and light foreground for widgets and panes, with a light
background and dark background, or (the default) follow whatever
colour scheme is in use for the desktop as a whole.</li>

<p><li>Font size for text overlays: This controls the fonts used for
displaying text of various sorts in the pane areas.</li>

<p><li>Location for cache file directory: Sonic Visualiser may cache a
large amount of data in temporary files when doing spectral analysis.
This preference allows you to choose where that data should be cached,
for example to ensure it is on a large enough partition or disk.</li>

<p><li>Resample mismatching files on import: If you load two audio
files into the same session that have different sample rates, Sonic
Visualiser will (by default) do nothing to compensate and will simply
play the second of them at the wrong speed.  If this preference is
set, Sonic Visualiser will instead resample the second one to match
the rate of the first when it imports it.  It is off by default
because resampling affects the display of the audio, as well as its
playback.</li>

<p><li>Playback resampler type: Selects the resampler that will be
used during playback of audio files that need to be resampled for the
current playback audio device.</li>


<p><li>Frequency of concert A: This is the frequency that will be used
as the reference for a "concert A" (the A above middle C) when drawing
the vertical scale on log-frequency <a
href="#spectrogram">spectrograms</a> or calculating automatic
alignments between spectrogram and <a href="#notes">note layers</a>.</li>

<p><li>Spectrogram y-axis interpolation: Selects the smoothing style
for <a href="#spectrogram">spectrogram</a> bins that take up more than
one vertical pixel.  When displaying a linear-frequency spectrogram
with a relatively small FFT window size (i.e. a small number of
vertical bins), or a log-frequency spectrogram in which a single bin
at a low frequency occupies a relatively large space vertically, or
when zoomed in close up to any spectrogram, the visible "blockiness"
of the spectrogram can be reduced by applying smoothing.<br><br>The
highest quality (but slowest) smoothing is provided by the "4x
Oversampled" option, which uses a zero-padded FFT; the "Linear" option
provides faster but lower quality smoothing using linear
interpolation.<br><br>Be aware that although smoothing may make the
"trend" of a spectrogram contour easier to perceive, it does not
actually increase the meaningful resolution of the spectrogram:
instead it just interpolates from the values that were there already.
To raise the actual vertical resolution, you need to increase the
spectrogram window size &mdash; with a consequent reduction in
horizontal resolution, that can be compensated for to a certain degree
by increasing the window overlap.</li>

<p><li>Spectral analysis window shape: When calculating FFT data for
spectral applications such as spectrogram or as frequency-domain input
for Vamp plugins, Sonic Visualiser uses the standard practice of
multiplying each block of time-domain audio data with a shaped window
before passing it to the FFT.  The resulting spectral domain data
contains artifacts corresponding to the FFT of the window shape; the
shape of the window is chosen to reduce those artifacts in comparison
to the effectively rectangular window that would apply if no other
shape was used.<br><br>The window shape used for this procedure can be
selected here.  The shape of the chosen window in the time domain (on
the left) and frequency domain (on the right, the result of an FFT of
the time-domain window shape) are displayed above the window shape
selection menu.  The default Hann window is appropriate for most
purposes.</li>
