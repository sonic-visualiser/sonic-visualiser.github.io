<p>Sonic Lineup is an application for comparative visualisation and
alignment of related audio recordings.  This is a brief reference
manual explaining the concepts used in Sonic Lineup and how to use it.
This manual describes Sonic Lineup version 1.0.</p>

<a name="purpose"></a><h2>1 &nbsp;What Sonic Lineup is For</h2>

      <p>Sonic Lineup is intended for visualisation and inspection of
        multiple audio files which are related by way of representing
        the same "source material".
      </p>
      <p>This could mean they are recordings of different performances
        of the same work; different recordings of the same
        performance; different "takes" of parts in a studio session;
        or perhaps recordings of variant works or cover songs, so long
        as they are broadly structurally similar.
      </p>
      <p>With multiple such audio files loaded, Sonic Lineup will
        attempt to <a href="#alignment">align them in time</a>, based
        on an analysis of their audio content, so that you can
        navigate them in sync with one another in terms of the common
        musical content they represent. A number of
        different <a href="#viewmodes">visualisation modes</a> are
        provided, and switching modes takes effect for all loaded
        files at once.
      </p>
      <p>Sonic Lineup also supports <a href="playback">recording</a>
      directly from the microphone or other audio input.
      </p>
      <p>Sonic Lineup is <b>not</b> designed for editing, annotation,
        precision measurement, or any custom analysis of audio. No
        editing facilities are included, no adjustable parameters for
        the visualisation modes are provided, and it is not possible
        to save or export any kind of annotation or session
        information. In contrast
        to <a href="https://sonicvisualiser.org/">Sonic
        Visualiser</a>, Sonic Lineup is intended for "quick"
        comparative analysis, rather than for intensive study.</p>
      
      <a name="layout"></a><h2>2 &nbsp;Window Layout</h2>
      
      <p><div align="center"><img class="banner" src="images/whole.png"/><br><i>Sonic Lineup with four audio files loaded</i></div></p>

      <p>Most of the Sonic Lineup window is taken up with a view of
        all of the audio files that you have opened. You can clear
        this using the <img class="icon"
        src="images/icons/filenew.svg"/> Clear Session toolbar button
        or menu option, and you can add one or more audio files using
        <img class="icon" src="images/icons/fileopen.svg"/> Add Files,
        selecting multiple files at once in the resulting file dialog
        if desired.</p>

      <p>The first file opened in a session is considered to be the
        Reference file, and is labelled as such at the left edge. The
        other files will be <a href="#alignment">aligned</a> with
        respect to the reference file.</p>

      <p>
        The set of files you have opened is remembered from one run of
        Sonic Lineup to the next: when you start the application, it
        re-opens the same files as were open when it last exited. You
        can also pick from among recently-opened sets of files using
        the File -&gt; Recent Sessions menu.
      </p>

      <p>All files share a common position corresponding to an aligned
        time in the Reference file, indicated with a solid white line
        through the middle of each file in the view. Dragging left and
        right will move this reference point through all of the files at
        once, in alignment. This point is also the "playhead" for audio
        playback, so the file views will naturally scroll during
        playback, and the playhead may be moved during playback by
        dragging any view.</p>

      <p>The lighter grey vertical lines arranged across the file
        views contain points on the <a href="#salientfeatures">Salient
          Feature Layer</a>, which is calculated from the Reference file
        and then mapped across to the rest to show the correspondence
        calculated from the automatic alignment process.</p>
      
      <p>At the bottom of the window are the <a href="#viewmodes">view
          mode</a> selection buttons and <a href="#playback">audio
          playback speed and volume/pan</a> controls.</p>
