      <p>Sonic Visualiser 1.0 showing a waveform pane and a melodic
      range spectrogram pane.  (The music is "After the Pain" by <a
      href="http://www.telefonica.net/web2/pinojazz/">Carlos
      Pino</a>.)</p><p>Overlaid on the spectrogram is a note layer,
      showing the output of a note-tracker Vamp plugin that is being
      evaluated.  The notes from the tracker are played using a piano
      sample, configured in the plugin dialog visible.</p>

      <br>

      <div align=center><a href="images/sv-1.0-wide.png"><img src="images/sv-1.0-wide-thumb.png" border=1></a></div>

      <p>Sonic Visualiser 1.0 showing about a minute of the final
      movement of Mahler's 9th symphony, performed by the Czech
      Philharmonic under Vaclav Neumann.  (In fact the whole final
      movement is loaded and may be scrolled through &ndash; see the
      green overview at the bottom of the window.)

      <p>The waveform pane at the top is overlaid with a spectral
      centroid calculation (the coloured shading), the outputs of two
      note onset detection Vamp plugins (red and black vertical lines
      &ndash; neither of them seems to work very well on this sort of
      music) and the onset likelihood function from a third onset
      detection plugin (the blue curve). The spectrogram pane below it
      shows estimated instantaneous frequencies for peak FFT bins.</p>

      <br>

      <div align=center><a href="images/sv-1.0-ru.png"><img src="images/sv-1.0-ru-thumb.png" border=1></a></div>

      <p>Sonic Visualiser 1.0 in Russian &ndash; translation thanks to
      the hard work of Alexandre Prokoudine.  The Russian translation
      is included in the standard program and should be used
      automatically if your locale is set appropriately.</p>

      <p>Here we see a log-frequency spectrogram and a waveform of
      part of Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right".  (The
      music's in English.)</p>

      <br>      

      <div align=center><a href="images/sv2.png"><img src="images/sv2-thumb.png" border=1></a></div>

      <p>Sonic Visualiser 0.9 showing a waveform, beat locations
      detected by a Vamp plugin, an onset likelihood curve, a
      spectrogram with instantaneous frequency estimates and a
      "harmonic cursor" showing the relative locations of higher
      harmonics of a frequency, a waveform mapped to dB scale, and an
      amplitude measure shown using a colour shading.</p>

      <p>The three panes in this window are at quite different zoom
      levels; the green overview at the bottom shows three rectangles
      corresponding to the regions shown in each of the three panes
      above.  As you scroll through one pane, the other panes move
      accordingly (at different speeds depending on their zoom levels)
      to remain aligned at the centre.</p>
