=== 5th November 2015 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v1.3 released

== Changes in Sonic Annotator 1.3 since the previous release 1.2:

Back-end (feature writer) changes:

 - Add the --csv-digits, --lab-digits, and --jams-digits options to
   control the number of significant figures printed for feature values

 - Update the JAMS writer to JAMS 0.2.0 format

 - Show a more useful error message when user provides a filename
   instead of a transform id to the -d option (happened to me when
   cut-and-pasting command lines and I was quite baffled at first)
