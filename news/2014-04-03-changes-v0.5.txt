=== 3rd April 2014 &mdash; Tony v0.5 released

== Changes in Tony 0.5 since the previous release 0.4:

 - The start and end of the recording are now shaded in grey so you
   can see where they are

 - There are new save/open session functions on the File menu; the
   session file extension is .ton, and save/open session should work

 - The note edit tool (which was largely broken in 0.4 after lots of
   work on pitch track editing) now works again

 - New note editing menu actions: split note, merge notes, form note
   from selection, snap notes to pitch track

 - Editing the pitch track (when notes are present) causes the notes
   to be automatically updated to the new pitch track

 - The Key and Mouse Reference help window has been updated so as to
   show Tony-specific actions properly

 - The undo/redo command bundling has been tidied up and some related
   crashes fixed
