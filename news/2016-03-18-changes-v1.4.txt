=== 18th March 2016 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v1.4 released

== Changes in Sonic Annotator 1.4 since the previous release 1.3:

Front-end changes:

 - Better error reporting, especially for invalid transform files
   and transform-not-found

 - Avoid crashing out when a single plugin (that is not being used)
   can't be loaded because of e.g. an undefined symbol

Bug fixes:

 - Fix (with test) horrible crash with --multiplex option

 - Fix erroneous quantization to 16 bits for coded file types of
   greater bit depth

 - Fix multiple outputs when requesting both summary and non-summary
   for the same output
