=== 5th May 2010 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.7.2 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.7.2 since the previous release 1.7.1:

 - The time-value layer now has an origin line and an option to
 show derivatives (change from one point to the next) rather than
 raw values

 - A static initialiser race has been fixed, possibly fixing an
 occasional crash on startup in Windows

 - A crash when pressing Play straight after New Session has been
 fixed
