=== 25th May 2017 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.0.3 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.0.3 since the previous release 3.0.2:

 - Improve decisions about where and how to label vertical scales

 - Update build support material and documentation to reflect the
   official release of Cap'n Proto 0.6 (which we can now use rather
   than depending on git builds)
