=== 12th March 2014 &mdash; Tony v0.4 released

== Changes in Tony 0.4 since the previous release 0.3:

 - The main pitch tracker (pYIN) now uses a non-FFT Yin method in
   order to produce unbiased timestamps

 - Pitch estimation within a constrained frequency range now uses a
   harmonic spectrum plugin (CHP) that tracks peaks within the range
   in a way more in line with user expectations than pYIN

 - The layer show/hide controls have been merged into the layer type
   icons, saving toolbar space

 - Adjustment of the displayed frequency range has been crudely added

 - Fix crash on loading a second file and inability to export pitch
   track after using selection strip
