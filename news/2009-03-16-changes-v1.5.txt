=== 16th March 2009 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.5 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.5 since the previous release 1.4:

 - You can now insert time instants, time values, and notes using
 a MIDI device during playback.  If a time value or note layer is
 current it will be used for insertion (giving a value equal to
 the pitch class, or the played note, respectively); otherwise an
 existing or new time instants layer will be used just as it is
 when inserting instants using the PC keyboard.  Using a MIDI
 device should give better timing than using the PC keyboard.

 - There is a new Activity Log window with a (purely informative) list
 of events and user interactions that happen while SV is running.

 - The spectrogram has somewhat improved graphical scaling, and
 this is now the default (being much faster than the 4x oversampled
 method).  The previous default is still available as a preference.

 - Visualisation of very dense colour plots (such as spectrograms
 calculated by plugins) is substantially faster in this release.

 - Spectrogram display is now faster in many circumstances.

 - Alignment using the MATCH plugin is faster on OS/X than before.

 - SV will take into account RDF plugin descriptions, if available,
 in order to make somewhat better decisions about display of plugin
 outputs (for example, placing segmentation data into a layer with
 segmentation plot type).

 - You can now switch layers by clicking on the spare area at the left
 end of the pane that is also used for the current pane indicator.

 - The vertical black lines dividing segments in the time value
 layer's segmentation plot style are now optional.

 - Several widget layout bugs on OS/X have been fixed.

 - Several serious crashing, deadlock, and data corruption bugs have
 been fixed.
