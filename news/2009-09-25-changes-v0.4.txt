=== 25th September 2009 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v0.4 released

== Changes in Sonic Annotator 0.4 since the previous release 0.3:

Build changes:

 - Sonic Annotator now requires the Vamp plugin SDK v2.1 or newer.

Front-end changes:

 - Frequency-domain plugins now use the PluginInputDomainAdapter's new
 ShiftData processing method, ensuring that the first block received
 by the plugin is the one centred on 0 rather than starting at 0.
 Unfortunately, the old behaviour omitted a timing compensation step,
 and this fix actually changes the results from some plugin processes:
 the previous behaviour was not always in line with the Vamp plugin
 specification.

 - More useful diagnostics are now available when a plugin fails to
 load or run.

CSV back-end (feature writer) changes:

 - The CSV writer now closes its output files properly when it
 finishes writing to each one, rather than leaving them all open
 until the end and risk running out of file descriptors.  This was
 already the behaviour of the RDF writer, the CSV one has just been
 updated to match it.

 - The behaviour of the CSV writer has also been changed to match
 that of the RDF writer in handling file write failures (it now
 continues processing only if --force is given).
