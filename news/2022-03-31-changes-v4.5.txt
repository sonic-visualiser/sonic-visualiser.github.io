=== 31st March 2022 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v4.5 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser v4.5 since the previous release 4.4:

 - Add option to switch off the interpolation used in the waveform
   view for zoom levels closer than one pixel per frame: sometimes it
   can be an unnecessary distraction. With interpolation switched off,
   the individual samples are shown as unconnected points instead

 - Make it possible to toggle segment colouring in the segmentation
   view of the time value layer, as well as toggling segment division
   lines

 - When importing CSV files, if a column heading indicates a likely
   unit for the column, use it by default; also remember last user
   settings for the import dialog

 - Ensure the Choose Default Template option on the templates menu can
   be reached even when no file is loaded

 - Give the spectrum layer the same effective scale range as it had
   before the dB scale fix in v4.4, fixing the accidental halving of
   the visible range for that layer in v4.4

 - Fix hang when opening two plugin parameter dialogs at once

 - Fix crash when rendering slice or spectrum layers scrolled to
   earlier than the start of the audio or later than the end

 - Fix crash when more than one audio file is supplied at the command
   line with a default session template that requires regenerating one
   or more feature extraction layers and layer generation produces an
   error or warning

 - Fix failure to exit fully if the window is closed before plugin
   scan is complete at startup
