=== 17th September 2021 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v4.4 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser v4.4 since the previous release 4.3:

 - Update Mac build to add support for Apple M1 (arm64) architecture:
   the official package is now a universal binary app, and the arm64
   slice can use both (existing) x86_64 and (future) arm64 Vamp plugins

 - Fix long-standing idiosycratic choice of dB scale, so as to conform
   to conventional usage for root-power quantities. That is, dB values
   for audio signals are now 20 x log10 rather than 10 x log10. Power
   and power-like signals (where units are available) remain 10 x
   log10

 - Fix time lag between visual position of playback pointer and actual
   audio played, particularly when playing files resampled from one
   rate to another

 - When recording audio into an empty session with an active session
   template that includes one or more plugin transforms, re-run the
   transforms when recording finishes, instead of only when the
   recorded model is first created (so as to get proper results for
   the full recording)

 - Fix failure to re-run transforms when loading a session or template
   before the initial plugin scan has completed

 - Fix misalignment and potential crash when rendering 3d plots with
   variant sample rates

 - Change interpretation of modifiers (shift/alt) for the mouse
   scroll-wheel, and the documentation for them, so as to be
   consistent with one another and with other contexts
