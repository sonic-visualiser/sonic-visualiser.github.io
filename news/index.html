<h3>October 2019 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v4.0 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser v4.0 since the previous release 3.3:</h4>
<ul><li>Add Box annotation layer type, typically used for time-frequency
   boxes to be annotated over a spectrogram. Because this introduces a
   new layer type into the session file format, the major version
   number has been bumped to v4.0. Sessions saved from v4.0 can be
   opened in earlier versions of Sonic Visualiser, but any Box layers
   will not be loaded.</li></ul>
<h3>14th June 2019 &mdash; Sonic Lineup v0.3 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Lineup v0.3:</h4>
<ul><li>First public release</li>
<li>First build under this name</li></ul>
<h3>21st May 2019 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.3 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser v3.3 since the previous release 3.2.1:</h4>
<ul><li>Add support for reading the Opus audio codec on all platforms</li>
<li>Add support for WMA and AAC formats on 64-bit Windows. (AAC was
   already supported on macOS.) Note that AAC support on Windows does
   not support "gapless" import, i.e. removing the encoder gaps at
   start and end of the stream</li>
<li>Add ability to choose the field separator when importing CSV and
   CSV-like files, if more than one possible candidate separator is
   found in the file</li>
<li>Fix crash when closing session or starting a new session while
   calculating alignment of multiple audio files</li>
<li>Fix crash when running certain plugins that call for
   frequency-domain input at non-power-of-two block sizes</li>
<li>Fix wandering left edge of measure-tool rectangle while dragging
   out the area</li>
<li>Ensure that plugin stderr debug output is logged to the SV log file</li></ul>
<h3>7th January 2019 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.2.1 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.2.1 since the previous release 3.2:</h4>
<ul><li>Fix failure to record from built-in microphone on macOS 10.14
   (caused by lack of microphone permission request text)</li>
<li>Fix crash when closing SV or starting a new session during recording</li>
<li>Fix crash on exit in some builds that disable OSC support</li>
<li>Fix flashing effect when scrolling certain configurations of colour 3d
   plot layer leftwards</li></ul>
<h3>7th December 2018 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.2 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.2 since the previous release 3.1.1:</h4>
<ul><li>Add ability to zoom closer than one sample per pixel, so as to see
   the interpolated signal level between samples</li>
<li>Add oversampling control to the spectrogram and spectrum layers</li>
<li>Highlight and label frequency peaks in the spectrum as the mouse
   rolls over them, when enabled in the parameter area</li>
<li>Add feature to convert and import audio from a CSV data file</li>
<li>Add some new colour maps, and restore the old Blue on Black one</li>
<li>Speed up spectrum rendering at high resolutions</li>
<li>Fix failure to pass Nyquist bins correctly to
   frequency-domain-input Vamp plugins in some circumstances</li>
<li>Fix sometimes incorrect shortcut associations for new-layer menu
   items</li>
<li>Various other rendering improvements and bug fixes</li></ul>
<h3>14th August 2018 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.1.1 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.1.1 since the previous release 3.1:</h4>
<ul><li>Fix failure to record correctly into an empty session with certain
   audio drivers</li>
<li>Fix failure to run LADSPA plugins at all, except with some unusual
   path layouts</li>
<li>Fix failure to silence sonified notes when rewinding backwards or
   jumping back from a loop endpoint</li>
<li>Fix macOS .dmg image so as to use older HFS+ filesystem for compatibility</li></ul>
<h3>14th July 2018 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.1 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.1 since the previous release 3.0.3:</h4>
<ul><li>Add Plugins tab to Preferences dialog, from which you can review
   the plugin load paths and see which plugins were loaded from which
   locations, and also customise load paths (though the various path
   environment variables are still supported)</li>
<li>Stream the export of audio data and other CSV data so that
   very large exports don't hang the UI or run us out of memory
   (thanks to Lucas Thompson)</li>
<li>Ensure vertical scale appears for auto-align layers when there is
   nothing else to auto-align them to</li>
<li>Fix another long-standing Windows-platform wide-char/utf8
   conversion problem, with environment variable naming and contents</li>
<li>Improve handling of incomplete session loads, i.e. situations where
   the audio files referred to by a session could not be found -
   previously the session could be re-saved immediately thus losing
   the audio reference; now at least we disable Save (enabling only
   Save As) and show a warning</li>
<li>Update pane and layer menu shortcuts so that the
   waveform/spectrogram/etc shortcuts (Shift+G etc) operate on the
   source model in the currently-selected pane rather than the main
   model. This is a backward-incompatible change but is a far more
   intuitive way for the function to work</li>
<li>Use dark background for bright colours in time-value/note/etc
   layers as well as e.g. waveforms - this is how it was always
   "intended to" work, but it is a backward-incompatible change</li>
<li>Make "Select All" select the whole span of everything that exists,
   not just the main model</li>
<li>Add horizontal scale to Spectrum layer</li>
<li>Improve spacing and labelling of vertical log scales</li>
<li>Update build system for better Cap'n Proto version support and to
   use Repoint for code management in the repository</li>
<li>Various other bug fixes</li></ul>
<h3>25th May 2017 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.0.3 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.0.3 since the previous release 3.0.2:</h4>
<ul><li>Improve decisions about where and how to label vertical scales</li>
<li>Update build support material and documentation to reflect the
   official release of Cap'n Proto 0.6 (which we can now use rather
   than depending on git builds)</li></ul>
<h3>25th May 2017 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v1.5 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Annotator 1.5 since the previous release 1.4:</h4>
<p>Front-end changes:</p>
<ul><li>Change mp3 file loading so as to compensate for encoder/decoder
   delay and padding (using "gapless playback" logic). While this is a
   real improvement, unfortunately it does mean that the initial
   padding in mp3 file load has changed from previous versions, which
   may change alignment of features based on mp3 files relative to
   those generated by previous versions. It's not a great idea to use
   mp3 as a file format of record, because of differences like this
   between decoders</li>
<li>Add --transform-minversion flag to test for available version of
   a plugin transform</li>
<li>Add quiet mode (-q)</li>
</ul><p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul><li>Fix possible crash in multiplexed file handling (--multiplex, -m)</li>
<li>Fix nominal rounding error (out by 1ns) in output under some
   conditions</li></ul>
<h3>25th March 2017 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.0.2 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.0.2 since the previous release 3.0.1:</h4>
<ul><li>Fix crash when changing parameters for spectrum view</li>
<li>Fix incorrect measure tool crosshairs in spectrum view</li>
<li>Update Russian and Czech UI translations (thanks to Alexandre Prokoudine
   and Pavel Fric respectively)</li></ul>
<h3>12th March 2017 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.0.1 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.0.1 since the previous release 3.0:</h4>
<ul><li>Fix crashes with MIDI devices and speedup/slowdown control on Windows</li>
<li>Update MIDI input driver layer</li></ul>
<h3>7th March 2017 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.0 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.0 since the previous release 2.5:</h4>
<ul><li>Add ability to record audio, and ability to change the audio device
   for playback or recording in the preferences</li>
<li>Add complete support for high-resolution (Hi-DPI or retina)
   displays, including for layer data rendering as well as UI controls
   and icons. This makes the biggest difference when using a retina
   Mac, on which previous versions did not render layer data at retina
   resolution, but it also improves scaling and rendering of UI
   elements on Hi-DPI displays on Windows and Linux</li>
<li>Add ability to export scalable (SVG) image files</li>
<li>Run plugins in a separate process, so that if a plugin crashes, it
   no longer brings down Sonic Visualiser with it. In every other
   respect the behaviour should be unchanged</li>
<li>Scan plugins on startup in a separate process, and report on any
   that crash or won't load</li>
<li>Add ability to open, display, and analyse very long audio files (of
   more than 2^32 sample frames)</li>
<li>Change mp3 file loading so as to compensate for encoder/decoder
   delay and padding (using "gapless playback" logic). While this is a
   real improvement, unfortunately it does mean that the initial
   padding in mp3 file load has changed from previous versions, which
   may mean some sessions saved in previous versions are no longer
   correctly aligned. It's not a great idea to use mp3 as a file
   format of record, because of differences like this between
   decoders. The previous behaviour is still available as a preference.</li>
<li>Add new Hybrid normalisation type for spectrogram and colour 3d
   plot layers. This normalises each column to its peak value and then
   scales the normalised values by the log of the peak in order to
   restore some distinction in scale between columns with different
   levels. It can provide quite visually clear results.</li>
<li>Add function to subdivide time instant layers into regular
   intervals (and its inverse)</li>
<li>Add new preference for default colour scales</li>
<li>Add a basic ability to zoom (in the frequency axis) to the spectrum</li>
<li>Switch to using combined level/pan controls in layer property boxes
   and for the main volume control</li>
<li>Make CSV file reader better able to handle files with varying
   numbers of columns</li>
<li>Fix a number of problems on Windows with loading and saving some
   file formats to filenames not representable in system codepage</li>
<li>Add "What's New" dialog</li>
<li>Finally switch the Windows build to 64-bit by default (with
   adapters to run either 32- or 64-bit plugins)</li></ul>
<h3>18th March 2016 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v1.4 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Annotator 1.4 since the previous release 1.3:</h4>
<p>Front-end changes:</p>
<ul><li>Better error reporting, especially for invalid transform files
   and transform-not-found</li>
<li>Avoid crashing out when a single plugin (that is not being used)
   can't be loaded because of e.g. an undefined symbol</li>
</ul><p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul><li>Fix (with test) horrible crash with --multiplex option</li>
<li>Fix erroneous quantization to 16 bits for coded file types of
   greater bit depth</li>
<li>Fix multiple outputs when requesting both summary and non-summary
   for the same output</li></ul>
<h3>5th November 2015 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v1.3 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Annotator 1.3 since the previous release 1.2:</h4>
<p>Back-end (feature writer) changes:</p>
<ul><li>Add the --csv-digits, --lab-digits, and --jams-digits options to
   control the number of significant figures printed for feature values</li>
<li>Update the JAMS writer to JAMS 0.2.0 format</li>
<li>Show a more useful error message when user provides a filename
   instead of a transform id to the -d option (happened to me when
   cut-and-pasting command lines and I was quite baffled at first)</li></ul>
<h3>23rd October 2015 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v2.5 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 2.5 since the previous release 2.4.1:</h4>
<ul><li>Add unit-converter dialog, for converting between various pitch and
   timing units</li>
<li>Fix failure to reload note layers from session file</li>
<li>Use a more sensible scale for the play-speed dial</li>
<li>Fix crash when importing very wide CSV files</li>
<li>Fix generation of wrong layer type from some CSV files</li>
<li>Fix failure to export last instant in a time-instant layer</li></ul>
<h3>23rd October 2015 &mdash; Tony v2.0 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Tony 2.0 since the previous release 1.0:</h4>
<ul><li>Tony now has a Record button, allowing you to record audio from the
   microphone and analyse it</li>
<li>Graphical rendering and icons now properly support hi-dpi/Retina
   displays</li>
<li>The playback speed dial uses a more sensible scale</li></ul>
<h3>1st September 2015 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v1.2 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Annotator 1.2 since the previous release 1.1:</h4>
<p>Front-end changes:</p>
<ul><li>Add the --segments-from option, providing the ability to read
   segment boundaries from a file</li>
</ul><p>Back-end (feature writer) changes:</p>
<ul><li>Rename the JSON feature writer to JAMS. There may be other JSON
   formats supported in future</li>
</ul><p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul><li>Fix invalid JSON written by JAMS feature writer for dense
   features</li>
<li>Fix invalid UTF-8 output from RDF feature writer when processing
   MP3 files having ID3 tags in non-ASCII, non-UTF8 encodings</li></ul>
<h3>1st April 2015 &mdash; Tony v1.0 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Tony 1.0 since the previous release 0.6:</h4>
<ul><li>The underlying pYin analysis plugin has been updated; more analysis
   options are available</li>
<li>Notes can be dragged up and down using the mouse in edit mode. When
   you drag a note, the pitch track underneath it snaps to the nearest
   spectral peaks (if any are found). Releasing the note makes the
   note snap back to the (possibly now moved) underlying pitch values.</li>
<li>Exported pitch track CSV files now contain one row for every
   processing frame in the file, and those with no identified pitch
   have the pitch recorded as 0. This is useful for some evaluation
   and post-processing tools, and it's easier to filter out the 0
   values if you don't need them than add them afterwards if you do</li>
<li>Exported note track CSV files now omit the (meaningless, in this
   context) velocity column</li>
<li>Level and pan for a layer (audio, pitch track, notes) are now shown
   in a little matrix widget, which is quicker to read than the
   previous pair of rotary dials; click on it to pop up an editable
   version</li>
<li>Horizontal scrolling using a Mac trackpad now works properly</li>
<li>Tony now finds plugins in its own installation directory by default
   (can be overridden with TONY_VAMP_PATH environment variable)</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li></ul>
<h3>16th October 2014 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v1.1 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Annotator 1.1 since the previous release 1.0:</h4>
<p>Front-end changes:</p>
<ul><li>Add support for the start time and duration properties of a
   transform, applying a plugin to only a range of the input audio</li>
<li>Reduce the internal processing blocksize from 16384 to 1024 samples
   to reduce extent of time rounding at end of file or range</li>
<li>Add --multiplex option to compose multiple audio files into a
   single multi-channel stream with one input file per channel</li>
<li>Add --normalise to request each audio file be normalised to 1.0 max</li>
<li>Add support for the plugin_version property of a transform, causing
   Sonic Annotator to refuse to run with the wrong version of a plugin</li>
<li>Add --minversion option to permit scripts to check that the
   version of Sonic Annotator is as they expect</li>
<li>Add new housekeeping options to list the available feature writers
   and supported audio file formats</li>
<li>Pull out the feature-writer-specific help text into separate help
   options (-h <writertype>) as the help was getting too long</li>
</ul><p>Back-end (feature writer) changes:</p>
<ul><li>Add --csv-omit-filename, --csv-end-times, and --csv-fill-ends
   options to the CSV feature writer to adjust various aspects of its
   output</li>
<li>Add "json" feature writer, exporting to JAMS (JSON Annotated Music
   Specification) format. This writer is provisional and is expected
   to change in future releases to comply more effectively with the
   specification</li>
<li>Add "midi" feature writer, exporting to MIDI files</li>
<li>Add "lab" feature writer, exporting to tab-separated label files.
   (This is equivalent to using the CSV writer with a tab separator and
   the new --csv-omit-filename and --csv-end-times options, but it's
   simpler to use if .lab is what you want)</li>
</ul><p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul><li>Fix the former habit of forging ahead even if not all transform
   files could be found or parsed (this may have been intentional
   behaviour but it is confusing more than it is useful)</li>
<li>Fix failure to support --summary-only flag when reading transforms
   with summaries from a transform file</li></ul>
<h3>1st October 2014 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v2.4.1 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 2.4.1 since the previous release 2.4:</h4>
<ul><li>Fix a crash when rendering certain colour 3d plot layers</li></ul>
<h3>1st September 2014 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v2.4 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 2.4 since the previous release 2.3:</h4>
<ul><li>Add support for left/right scrolling using a two-finger touchpad
   gesture (where available)</li>
<li>Make the octave numbering into a configurable option, and change
   the default. Previously Sonic Visualiser labelled middle-C as "C3";
   now it labels middle-C as "C4", a more common standard in the world
   outside MIDI sequencer software. The previous system is available
   as an option in the Preferences. This affects only the visible
   labels: there is no change to analysis or to the file format</li>
<li>Sonify time-value layers. Any time-value curve whose scale unit is
   set to Hz will now acquire a playback toggle control; this control
   is off by default, but if it is switched on, the curve will be
   played back using a variable-frequency sound generator</li>
<li>Add support for playback of note layers with non-MIDI frequencies
   (formerly the note playback was limited to exact MIDI pitch)</li>
<li>Change the default playback sample for note layers from piano to an
   electric piano with sustain. The piano sample is still available,
   and any sessions saved using it should continue to use it</li>
<li>Add a cancel button for Vamp plugin processing: currently,
   cancelling a transform results in a part-complete layer rather than
   removing the results</li>
<li>Add keyboard shortcuts to cycle the current layer (in addition to
   the existing ones to cycle the current pane)</li>
<li>Fix various bugs related to layer ordering: layer tabs re-ordering
   themselves randomly when new layer added, layers being ordered
   randomly when saving and reloading a session</li>
<li>Fix incorrect interaction with non-Unicode usernames when creating
   temporary and template directories on Windows</li>
<li>Shade the start and end of the main audio file, to make them easier
   to see for files that start or end in silence</li>
<li>Speed up rendering and scrolling in time-value layers</li>
<li>Make it possible to import CSV files directly into Note layers by
   adding Pitch as a data type in the CSV file import dialog</li>
<li>Fix play pointer jump to wrong frame when clicking on row in the
   layer edit dialog</li>
<li>Fix problems with keyboard shortcuts when using Qt5 on OS/X. This
   is the first release in which the official builds use Qt5 for all
   platforms.</li></ul>
<h3>16th June 2014 &mdash; Tony v0.6 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Tony 0.6 since the previous release 0.5:</h4>
<ul><li>The play pointer no longer tracks to the centre of the main pane
   when dragging, and is now always visible. Play pointer / playhead
   behaviour is generally expected to be much more sensible and
   intuitive in this release than in prior ones</li>
<li>Many keyboard shortcuts have been added and improved, including the
   shortcuts for incremental note-by-note selection and moving the
   play pointer</li>
<li>Audio files are now implicitly normalised to peak == 1.0 when
   loading</li>
<li>Tony now has an Analysis menu which contains various configuration
   settings that affect pitch analysis</li>
<li>There is now an option to save the session directly to the same
   directory as the original audio file, for rapid saving when
   annotating many audio files in sequence</li>
<li>The extents of the "active" note are now more clearly shown when
   mousing over the note track</li>
<li>There is a new function to delete the notes (without deleting pitch
   measurements) within the selection</li>
<li>Numerous bug fixes</li></ul>
<h3>3rd April 2014 &mdash; Tony v0.5 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Tony 0.5 since the previous release 0.4:</h4>
<ul><li>The start and end of the recording are now shaded in grey so you
   can see where they are</li>
<li>There are new save/open session functions on the File menu; the
   session file extension is .ton, and save/open session should work</li>
<li>The note edit tool (which was largely broken in 0.4 after lots of
   work on pitch track editing) now works again</li>
<li>New note editing menu actions: split note, merge notes, form note
   from selection, snap notes to pitch track</li>
<li>Editing the pitch track (when notes are present) causes the notes
   to be automatically updated to the new pitch track</li>
<li>The Key and Mouse Reference help window has been updated so as to
   show Tony-specific actions properly</li>
<li>The undo/redo command bundling has been tidied up and some related
   crashes fixed</li></ul>
<h3>12th March 2014 &mdash; Tony v0.4 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Tony 0.4 since the previous release 0.3:</h4>
<ul><li>The main pitch tracker (pYIN) now uses a non-FFT Yin method in
   order to produce unbiased timestamps</li>
<li>Pitch estimation within a constrained frequency range now uses a
   harmonic spectrum plugin (CHP) that tracks peaks within the range
   in a way more in line with user expectations than pYIN</li>
<li>The layer show/hide controls have been merged into the layer type
   icons, saving toolbar space</li>
<li>Adjustment of the displayed frequency range has been crudely added</li>
<li>Fix crash on loading a second file and inability to export pitch
   track after using selection strip</li></ul>
<h3>6th March 2014 &mdash; Tony v0.3 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Tony 0.3 since the previous release 0.2:</h4>
<ul><li>Key shortcuts for editing have been revised to be more consistent
   on OS/X and across different Qt versions</li>
<li>Reduce visual clutter in selection areas</li>
<li>Fixes to OS/X deployment</li></ul>
<h3>5th March 2014 &mdash; Tony v0.2 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Tony 0.2 since the previous release 0.1:</h4>
<ul><li>Waveform is now displayed in a shadow layer at bottom of main pane</li>
<li>A selection strip has been added at the bottom of the window, so
   selections can be made without changing tool mode</li>
<li>Double-click in selection strip now selects a region associated
   with a single note</li>
<li>Pitches can be moved up and down by octaves, and to different pitch
   candidates, within the selected area</li>
<li>Cancelling a selection by hitting Esc restores the pre-selection
   pitch track</li>
<li>A frequency range can be selected with shift-click in the main
   window to prompt the pitch tracker to run only within that range</li>
<li>Arbitrary-frequency playback and pitch track resynthesis now supported</li>
<li>Layers can now be hidden, and playback toggled, individually, and
   there are now gain and pain controls for each playable layer type</li></ul>
<h3>12th December 2013 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v2.3 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 2.3 since the previous release 2.2:</h4>
<ul><li>Add a startup welcome dialog that also explains what SV makes
   network connections for and allows user to forbid them</li>
<li>Add "Export Audio Data" feature</li>
<li>Show piano keyboard scale in note and time-value layers as well
   as spectrogram, where vertical scale is log Hz; also show
   numerical scale in note and region layers when not auto-aligned</li>
<li>Speed up CSV file import and avoid showing crazily wide window
   for CSV file format dialog when file has lots of columns</li>
<li>Fix incorrectly saved window geometry when exiting from maximised
   state</li>
<li>Reduce number of timer wakeups when idle</li>
<li>Add American English translation and make choice of translation
   into a preference (defaulting to system locale)</li>
<li>Permit installation to non-default location with Windows installer
   build</li></ul>
<h3>31st July 2013 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v2.2 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 2.2 since the previous release 2.1:</h4>
<ul><li>Build with support for hidpi ("retina") text on OS/X</li>
<li>Fix very slow analysis when using Ogg or FLAC files decoded
   via libsndfile</li>
<li>Fix inaccurate scale auto-align between time-value layers and
   others</li>
<li>Fix failure to open files specified on command line (or via
   Open With) on Windows</li>
<li>Reset cyclical counters and switch back to navigate mode when
   a new session is started</li></ul>
<h3>16th May 2013 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v2.1 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 2.1 since the previous release 2.0.1:</h4>
<ul><li>Fix incorrect handling of FixedSampleRate outputs (Vamp SDK fix)</li>
<li>Make it easier to see results from transforms that return a single point</li>
<li>Make labelling clearer on time-value layers</li>
<li>Add discrete-curve mode for time-value layers (for curves with gaps)</li>

<li>The main window status bar now shows the last label to have passed
 the playback position in the current layer, at the right end of the
 status bar</li>
<li>The Russian translation has been updated (thanks Alexandre)</li></ul>
<h3>25th September 2009 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v0.4 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Annotator 0.4 since the previous release 0.3:</h4>
<p>Build changes:</p>
<ul><li>Sonic Annotator now requires the Vamp plugin SDK v2.1 or newer.</li>
</ul><p>Front-end changes:</p>
<ul><li>Frequency-domain plugins now use the PluginInputDomainAdapter's new
 ShiftData processing method, ensuring that the first block received
 by the plugin is the one centred on 0 rather than starting at 0.
 Unfortunately, the old behaviour omitted a timing compensation step,
 and this fix actually changes the results from some plugin processes:
 the previous behaviour was not always in line with the Vamp plugin
 specification.</li>
<li>More useful diagnostics are now available when a plugin fails to
 load or run.</li>
</ul><p>CSV back-end (feature writer) changes:</p>
<ul><li>The CSV writer now closes its output files properly when it
 finishes writing to each one, rather than leaving them all open
 until the end and risk running out of file descriptors.  This was
 already the behaviour of the RDF writer, the CSV one has just been
 updated to match it.</li>
<li>The behaviour of the CSV writer has also been changed to match
 that of the RDF writer in handling file write failures (it now
 continues processing only if --force is given).</li></ul>
<h3>5th September 2009 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.7 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.7 since the previous release 1.6:</h4>
<ul><li>A new "Insert Item At Selection" function on the Edit menu
 can be used to create Note and Region layer items whose time
 extents correspond to the current selection(s)</li>
<li>Interactively editing points in the Note and Region layers
 now works much more smoothly</li>
<li>SV can now import MIDI files that use SMPTE timecode for event
 timing (importing MIDI files using with the more common
 timebase-based timing was already supported)</li>
<li>Time values throughout the display may optionally be shown in
 seconds and frames at various frame rates</li>
<li>A crash on exit in Windows has been fixed</li>
<li>A very unobtrusive user survey is now included</li>
<li>Various other bug fixes.</li></ul>
<h3>22nd June 2009 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.6 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.6 since the previous release 1.5:</h4>
<ul><li>The Colour 3D Plot layer now supports logarithmic vertical
 scale and linear interpolation options.</li>
<li>A new colour scheme (High Gain) has been added for spectrogram
 and Colour 3D Plot, which improves readability for some data.</li>
<li>Further performance improvements have been made to Colour 3D
 Plot.</li>
<li>Various other bug fixes.</li></ul>
<h3>16th March 2009 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.5 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.5 since the previous release 1.4:</h4>
<ul><li>You can now insert time instants, time values, and notes using
 a MIDI device during playback.  If a time value or note layer is
 current it will be used for insertion (giving a value equal to
 the pitch class, or the played note, respectively); otherwise an
 existing or new time instants layer will be used just as it is
 when inserting instants using the PC keyboard.  Using a MIDI
 device should give better timing than using the PC keyboard.</li>
<li>There is a new Activity Log window with a (purely informative) list
 of events and user interactions that happen while SV is running.</li>
<li>The spectrogram has somewhat improved graphical scaling, and
 this is now the default (being much faster than the 4x oversampled
 method).  The previous default is still available as a preference.</li>
<li>Visualisation of very dense colour plots (such as spectrograms
 calculated by plugins) is substantially faster in this release.</li>
<li>Spectrogram display is now faster in many circumstances.</li>
<li>Alignment using the MATCH plugin is faster on OS/X than before.</li>
<li>SV will take into account RDF plugin descriptions, if available,
 in order to make somewhat better decisions about display of plugin
 outputs (for example, placing segmentation data into a layer with
 segmentation plot type).</li>
<li>You can now switch layers by clicking on the spare area at the left
 end of the pane that is also used for the current pane indicator.</li>
<li>The vertical black lines dividing segments in the time value
 layer's segmentation plot style are now optional.</li>
<li>Several widget layout bugs on OS/X have been fixed.</li>
<li>Several serious crashing, deadlock, and data corruption bugs have
 been fixed.</li></ul>
<h3>5th December 2008 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.4 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.4 since the previous release 1.3:</h4>
<ul><li>SV now has a Region layer type, used for display of features with
 durations.  It also supports Vamp v2.0 plugins that provide durations
 for features.</li>
<li>Layer data can now be imported from RDF described using the Audio
 Features Ontology, as well as from the existing text file types.  SV
 can also export annotation layer data to RDF/Turtle, although in a
 somewhat simplistic manner at present.</li>
<li>You can search for transforms by text in the new "Find a Transform"
 dialog.  This searches both installed plugins, and plugins that have
 not been installed but that have descriptions available on the
 semantic web.</li>
<li>You can now zoom and scroll vertically in the time-value, note,
 and colour 3d plot layers.</li>
<li>Sonic Visualiser can now load sessions from uncompressed XML files
 as well as its own compressed-XML .sv format.  Files with extension
 .xml that contain suitable session data will be loaded as sessions.
 Note that .xml extension files still do not show up in the default
 file load filter.  This is intentional, as there may be any kind of
 data in them -- if you want to load uncompressed session files from
 XML, you need to know you're doing it.</li>
<li>Several crashes and other bugs have been fixed.</li></ul>
<h3>10th July 2008 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.3 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.3 since the previous release 1.2:</h4>
<ul><li>There is a new spreadsheet-style data viewer and editor for
 viewing and editing the data in some types of annotation layer.</li>
<li>Alignments are now saved to the session file.</li>
<li>The spectrogram layer is usually somewhat faster than it was.</li>
<li>You can now hold Shift while dragging to move an item, in order
 to override the initial drag resistance introduced in 1.2.</li>
<li>The gross mis-labelling of time lines in the ruler has been fixed.</li>
<li>There is a new, somewhat provisional PulseAudio output driver.</li>
<li>Several other bug fixes.</li></ul>
<h3>20th February 2008 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.2 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.2 since the previous release 1.0:</h4>
<ul><li>SV now supports time-alignment of multiple performances of a work
 loaded at the same time.  This option is enabled when the MATCH Vamp
 plugin is installed.  When alignment is switched on and more than one
 audio file is open, SV will assume that all open files are
 differently timed performances of the same work, and will calculate
 time alignments for them.  Playback will then play only a single file
 at a time, and the playback cursors in other files will track at the
 varying speeds to try to ensure that each is at the same point in the
 underlying score.  This enables effective comparison of several such
 files, as well as a meaningful way to switch from one performance to
 another during playback (ensuring that the switch happens at the
 correct point in the performance being switched to).</li>
<li>There is a new Image layer, which can display images from the
 local filesystem or retrieved via HTTP or FTP.</li>
<li>A new measurement tool has been added.  With the measurement tool
 selected, dragging in a pane draws a rectangle labelled with the
 scale values for its start and end corners and its size.  You can
 have any number of measurements present at once; they are associated
 with the top layer, their scale values depend on the scale for that
 layer, and they are only shown when that layer is at the top and the
 measurement tool is active.  Measurements are saved and reloaded in
 the session file.  Drawing measurements can be undone and redone, and
 a measurement can be deleted by hitting Del when highlighted.  Note
 that the measurement tool shows the scale values associated with the
 pixel positions of the mouse when dragging, not any values associated
 with actual features present in the audio or its analysis (e.g. the
 values are not rounded to the nearest spectrogram bin).</li>
<li>You can double-click using the measurement tool in the spectrogram
 to get an instant measurement rectangle for a feature.  This is a
 purely graphical feature that works by calculating the boundary of a
 contiguous region of pixels "similar to" the one you double-clicked
 on; it does not use audio analysis.  Adjusting the gain and colour
 scheme etc of the spectrogram will (by design) affect the
 measurements obtained this way.</li>
<li>The spectrum can now optionally show frequency estimates of peaks
 aligned with a piano keyboard along the horizontal axis (this needs
 some refinement).</li>
<li>The harmonic cursor in the spectrogram has moved from the Select
 tool to the Measurement tool.  There is now a similar harmonic cursor
 in the spectrum.  Both of them show more information as text
 alongside the cursor than previously.</li>
<li>There is a new Erase tool for erasing individual points from an
 editable layer.</li>
<li>Several keyboard shortcuts have changed -- all of the Alt+key
 shortcuts now either use Ctrl or a plain keypress with no modifier,
 to avoid clashes with window manager shortcuts and to make them
 easier to use and remember</li>
<li>The playback controls are now in a Playback menu as well as the
 toolbar.</li>
<li>There is a new key and mouse control reference under Help (or press
 F2).</li>
<li>You can double-click on a pane in navigate mode to jump to a time.</li>
<li>All of the single-colour layers (waveform, time values etc) now
 allow you to define your own colours as well as using the built-in
 set.  The colour of a layer is now shown next to its name on the pane.</li>
<li>When you add a new single-colour layer it will use a default colour
 that is not yet in use in another layer (if there is one).</li>
<li>Single-colour layers can now optionally have black backgrounds (with
 a set of lighter colours in the default colour palette that use black
 backgrounds by default).</li>
<li>There's a new Printer colour scheme in the spectrogram with only a
 small number of grey shades.</li>
<li>Vertical zoom in a log-scaled spectrogram is much more intuitive;
 it now leaves the point that was in the centre of the visible area in
 the centre after zoom, instead of the point that was in the centre of
 the linear range corresponding to the visible area.</li>
<li>You can now turn a colour 3d plot layer upside down by clicking the
 Invert Vertical Scale button.</li>
<li>There's a new Layer Summary window which shows the panes and
 layer data in a tree layout.  This is very simplistic at the moment.</li>
<li>Each pane now has an [X] button at its top left, which removes that
 pane when clicked.</li>
<li>There's a new Solo play mode toggle button; when active, only the
 currently selected pane is played.  This is also the default when
 time alignment is in use.</li>
<li>Rewind/ffwd now stay confined to the selection if Play Selection is
 enabled; also, the rewind and ffwd "one step" buttons are now enabled
 even if there is no time instants layer for them to align to (they
 align to the time ruler instead and so jump in steps of a size
 dependent on the zoom level).</li>
<li>You can now export note layers to MIDI.</li>
<li>MIDI note velocity is partially supported.  Note velocity is
 retained when importing and exporting MIDI and is used in playback,
 but it is not yet shown in the display and cannot yet be edited.</li>
<li>You can now drag-and-drop files (of whatever type) onto SV from
 other programs such as file managers or web browsers.</li>
<li>mp3 files (and Ogg, but they aren't supported on Windows at the
 moment) are now decoded in a background thread so you can see the
 start of the track without waiting for the rest to decode.</li>
<li>Mac builds of SV can now load AAC/mp4 files and anything else
 supported by QuickTime.</li>
<li>There is now an option to resample audio files on import if they
 don't match the samplerate of the first file loaded.  By default this
 is switched off, as it affects the visible waveform.  The default
 behaviour is unchanged (play at the wrong rate).  There is still no
 option to handle multiple rates "correctly" (i.e. by resampling
 on playback and showing the waveforms at different resolutions
 according to each one's underlying rate) and there probably never
 will be.</li>
<li>SV can now open .m3u playlist files, though it's a hazardous thing
 to do as it simply loads all the files in the playlist at once.</li>
<li>SV now has various options for how to number tapped time instants
 (bar/beat, plain counter, time in seconds, tempo etc).</li>
<li>The official builds use Qt 4.3, which fixes some nasty
 bugs in the file dialog that the version 1.0 builds suffered from.</li></ul>
<h3>7th July 2007 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v0.3 released</h3>
<h4>Changes in Sonic Annotator 0.3 since the previous release 0.2:</h4>
<p>Front-end changes:</p>
<ul><li>A new --force front-end option (distinct from the --csv-force and
 --rdf-force back-end options) has been added, which makes Sonic
 Annotator continue to process subsequent audio files instead of
 exiting after an error, if multiple audio files have been specified.</li>
</ul><p>RDF back-end (feature writer) changes:</p>
<ul><li>The RDF writer now conforms more correctly with the Music Ontology
 in the way it relates signal, track, and track metadata.  Signals
 that have available metadata now gain a Track resource to associate
 that metadata with, instead of hanging it directly from the Signal
 resource; also the audio file now encodes the signal rather than the
 signal being available as the audio file (matching the domain
 specification of the Music Ontology).  Note that this new resource
 structure will not be properly read by versions of Sonic Visualiser
 prior to 1.6 (should importing the data into Sonic Visualiser be of
 interest to you).</li>
<li>The --rdf-signal-uri option has been removed and replaced with the
 more meaningful set of options --rdf-audiofile-uri, --rdf-track-uri,
 and --rdf-maker-uri.</li>
<li>A new --rdf-network option is available, to cause Sonic Annotator
 to try to retrieve RDF descriptions for plugins from the network
 where those descriptions are not available locally.  Use of this
 option is recommended, but it is not the default because of the
 possible performance implication (even though the results are mostly
 cached, there may be some network access involved).</li>
<li>The RDF writer now writes the computed_by property for signal
 features.</li>
<li>Plugin and output URIs in the resulting RDF are now percent-encoded.</li></ul>
<h3>10th May 2007 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.0 released</h3>
