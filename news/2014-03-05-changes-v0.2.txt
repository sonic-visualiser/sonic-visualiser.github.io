=== 5th March 2014 &mdash; Tony v0.2 released

== Changes in Tony 0.2 since the previous release 0.1:

 - Waveform is now displayed in a shadow layer at bottom of main pane

 - A selection strip has been added at the bottom of the window, so
   selections can be made without changing tool mode

 - Double-click in selection strip now selects a region associated
   with a single note

 - Pitches can be moved up and down by octaves, and to different pitch
   candidates, within the selected area

 - Cancelling a selection by hitting Esc restores the pre-selection
   pitch track

 - A frequency range can be selected with shift-click in the main
   window to prompt the pitch tracker to run only within that range

 - Arbitrary-frequency playback and pitch track resynthesis now supported

 - Layers can now be hidden, and playback toggled, individually, and
   there are now gain and pain controls for each playable layer type
