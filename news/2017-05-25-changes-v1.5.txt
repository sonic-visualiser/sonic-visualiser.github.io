=== 25th May 2017 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v1.5 released

== Changes in Sonic Annotator 1.5 since the previous release 1.4:

Front-end changes:

 - Change mp3 file loading so as to compensate for encoder/decoder
   delay and padding (using "gapless playback" logic). While this is a
   real improvement, unfortunately it does mean that the initial
   padding in mp3 file load has changed from previous versions, which
   may change alignment of features based on mp3 files relative to
   those generated by previous versions. It's not a great idea to use
   mp3 as a file format of record, because of differences like this
   between decoders

 - Add --transform-minversion flag to test for available version of
   a plugin transform

 - Add quiet mode (-q)

Bug fixes:

 - Fix possible crash in multiplexed file handling (--multiplex, -m)

 - Fix nominal rounding error (out by 1ns) in output under some
   conditions
