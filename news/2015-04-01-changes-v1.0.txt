=== 1st April 2015 &mdash; Tony v1.0 released

== Changes in Tony 1.0 since the previous release 0.6:

 - The underlying pYin analysis plugin has been updated; more analysis
   options are available

 - Notes can be dragged up and down using the mouse in edit mode. When
   you drag a note, the pitch track underneath it snaps to the nearest
   spectral peaks (if any are found). Releasing the note makes the
   note snap back to the (possibly now moved) underlying pitch values.

 - Exported pitch track CSV files now contain one row for every
   processing frame in the file, and those with no identified pitch
   have the pitch recorded as 0. This is useful for some evaluation
   and post-processing tools, and it's easier to filter out the 0
   values if you don't need them than add them afterwards if you do

 - Exported note track CSV files now omit the (meaningless, in this
   context) velocity column

 - Level and pan for a layer (audio, pitch track, notes) are now shown
   in a little matrix widget, which is quicker to read than the
   previous pair of rotary dials; click on it to pop up an editable
   version

 - Horizontal scrolling using a Mac trackpad now works properly

 - Tony now finds plugins in its own installation directory by default
   (can be overridden with TONY_VAMP_PATH environment variable)

 - Bug fixes
