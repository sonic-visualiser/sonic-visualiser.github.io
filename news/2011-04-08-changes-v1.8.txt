=== 8th April 2011 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.8 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.8 since the previous release 1.7.2:

 - Sonic Visualiser now registers as a file type handler on OS/X,
 providing better integration with the desktop generally (Dan Stowell)

 - There is a new function to toggle all Time Rulers at once (key #)

 - The CSV import dialog has been overhauled, allowing more flexible
 selection of purpose for each column

 - Text overlays are now easier to read on dark backgrounds

 - Hidden layers are now ignored when exporting an image (Dan Stowell)

 - A crash when starting a new session or exiting the application
   after loading a session with saved alignment data has been fixed

 - The duplication of right-button menu functions when multiple files
 were loaded has been fixed

 - The layer-add menu functions now have shortcuts (Dan Stowell)

 - The codebase has been reorganised into libraries and a configure
 step added.  It should be easier to build and maintain on OS/X and
 Linux than previously, although it won't make much difference on
 Windows.

 - A Czech translation is now included (thanks to Pavel Fric).
