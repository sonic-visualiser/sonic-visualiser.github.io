=== 5th September 2009 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.7 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.7 since the previous release 1.6:

 - A new "Insert Item At Selection" function on the Edit menu
 can be used to create Note and Region layer items whose time
 extents correspond to the current selection(s)

 - Interactively editing points in the Note and Region layers
 now works much more smoothly

 - SV can now import MIDI files that use SMPTE timecode for event
 timing (importing MIDI files using with the more common
 timebase-based timing was already supported)

 - Time values throughout the display may optionally be shown in
 seconds and frames at various frame rates

 - A crash on exit in Windows has been fixed

 - A very unobtrusive user survey is now included

 - Various other bug fixes.
