=== 7th March 2017 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.0 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.0 since the previous release 2.5:

 - Add ability to record audio, and ability to change the audio device
   for playback or recording in the preferences

 - Add complete support for high-resolution (Hi-DPI or retina)
   displays, including for layer data rendering as well as UI controls
   and icons. This makes the biggest difference when using a retina
   Mac, on which previous versions did not render layer data at retina
   resolution, but it also improves scaling and rendering of UI
   elements on Hi-DPI displays on Windows and Linux

 - Add ability to export scalable (SVG) image files

 - Run plugins in a separate process, so that if a plugin crashes, it
   no longer brings down Sonic Visualiser with it. In every other
   respect the behaviour should be unchanged

 - Scan plugins on startup in a separate process, and report on any
   that crash or won't load

 - Add ability to open, display, and analyse very long audio files (of
   more than 2^32 sample frames)

 - Change mp3 file loading so as to compensate for encoder/decoder
   delay and padding (using "gapless playback" logic). While this is a
   real improvement, unfortunately it does mean that the initial
   padding in mp3 file load has changed from previous versions, which
   may mean some sessions saved in previous versions are no longer
   correctly aligned. It's not a great idea to use mp3 as a file
   format of record, because of differences like this between
   decoders. The previous behaviour is still available as a preference.

 - Add new Hybrid normalisation type for spectrogram and colour 3d
   plot layers. This normalises each column to its peak value and then
   scales the normalised values by the log of the peak in order to
   restore some distinction in scale between columns with different
   levels. It can provide quite visually clear results.

 - Add function to subdivide time instant layers into regular
   intervals (and its inverse)

 - Add new preference for default colour scales

 - Add a basic ability to zoom (in the frequency axis) to the spectrum

 - Switch to using combined level/pan controls in layer property boxes
   and for the main volume control

 - Make CSV file reader better able to handle files with varying
   numbers of columns

 - Fix a number of problems on Windows with loading and saving some
   file formats to filenames not representable in system codepage

 - Add "What's New" dialog

 - Finally switch the Windows build to 64-bit by default (with
   adapters to run either 32- or 64-bit plugins)
