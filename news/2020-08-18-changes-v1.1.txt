=== 18th August 2020 &mdash; Sonic Lineup v1.1 released

== Changes in Sonic Lineup v1.1 since the previous release 1.1:

 - Add an Alignment menu allowing you to choose one of a set of
   alignment methods, including new sung-notes alignment and an option
   for an external program that you supply

 - Add a subsequence alignment option for cases where the "other"
   tracks represent only fragments of the "reference"

 - Improve display of alignment views in cases where two adjacent
   tracks overlap each other in time only partially or not at all

 - Improve selection of font sizes and pane sizing, especially when
   many tracks are loaded

 - Speed up re-opening the application with many tracks in session

 - If alignment fails for all tracks because of some external factor,
   show the failure report dialog once only instead of for every track
