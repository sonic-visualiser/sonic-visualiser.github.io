=== 25th October 2019 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v4.0 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser v4.0 since the previous release 3.3:

 - Add Box annotation layer type, typically used for time-frequency
   boxes to be annotated over a spectrogram. Because this introduces a
   new layer type into the session file format, the major version
   number has been bumped to v4.0. Sessions saved from v4.0 can still
   be opened in earlier versions of Sonic Visualiser, but any Box
   layers will not be loaded

 - Fix behaviour of auto-align layers on top of waveform: they can now
   be aligned in the vertical scale, if they have a unit of V and the
   waveform is of a single channel in linear or dB mode

 - Make the UI more readable in macOS "dark mode"

 - Fix sluggishness in starting and stopping playback when using
   PulseAudio v13.0+
