=== 10th July 2008 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.3 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.3 since the previous release 1.2:

 - There is a new spreadsheet-style data viewer and editor for
 viewing and editing the data in some types of annotation layer.

 - Alignments are now saved to the session file.

 - The spectrogram layer is usually somewhat faster than it was.

 - You can now hold Shift while dragging to move an item, in order
 to override the initial drag resistance introduced in 1.2.

 - The gross mis-labelling of time lines in the ruler has been fixed.

 - There is a new, somewhat provisional PulseAudio output driver.

 - Several other bug fixes.
