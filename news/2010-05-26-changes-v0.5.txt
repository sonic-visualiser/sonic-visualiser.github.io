=== 26th May 2010 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v0.5 released

== Changes in Sonic Annotator 0.5 since the previous release 0.4:

Build changes:

 - Remove unused audioio library and avoid its dependencies

Front-end changes:

 - Avoid leaking file descriptors on exceptions

 - Fix embarrassing bug that caused failure to mix down to mono
 properly for single-channel plugins with multi-channel input files

 - Fail sooner if the output file is not writable (i.e. don't wait
 until the first data is available for writing)
