=== 21st May 2019 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.3 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser v3.3 since the previous release 3.2.1:

 - Add support for reading the Opus audio codec on all platforms

 - Add support for WMA and AAC formats on 64-bit Windows. (AAC was
   already supported on macOS.) Note that AAC support on Windows does
   not support "gapless" import, i.e. removing the encoder gaps at
   start and end of the stream

 - Add ability to choose the field separator when importing CSV and
   CSV-like files, if more than one possible candidate separator is
   found in the file

 - Fix crash when closing session or starting a new session while
   calculating alignment of multiple audio files

 - Fix crash when running certain plugins that call for
   frequency-domain input at non-power-of-two block sizes

 - Fix wandering left edge of measure-tool rectangle while dragging
   out the area

 - Ensure that plugin stderr debug output is logged to the SV log file
