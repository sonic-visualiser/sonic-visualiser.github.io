=== 25th October 2019 &mdash; Tony v2.1 released

== Changes in Tony 2.1 since the previous release 2.0:

   not support "gapless" import, i.e. removing the encoder gaps at
   start and end of the stream

 - Fix sluggishness in starting and stopping playback when using
   PulseAudio v13.0+

 - Update platform builds with newer libraries and updated platform
   support
