=== 22nd October 2009 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.7.1 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.7.1 since the previous release 1.7:

 - The RDF importer does a better job of assigning labels to layers,
 layers to panes, and values to labelled regions

 - Interactive editing in the Text layer benefits from the same
 improvements as made in 1.7 to Note and Region layers

 - The layer data editor window has a text search feature

 - The main window status bar now shows the last label to have passed
 the playback position in the current layer, at the right end of the
 status bar

 - The Russian translation has been updated (thanks Alexandre)
