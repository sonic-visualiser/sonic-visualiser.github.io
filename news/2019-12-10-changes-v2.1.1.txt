=== 10th December 2019 &mdash; Tony v2.1.1 released

== Changes in Tony 2.1.1 since the previous release 2.1:

 - Fix incorrect note numbering in display

 - Fix incorrect state of "Penalise Soft Pitches" option in Analysis
   menu. Previously this was displayed as if enabled, but the option
   was not actually active when performing the analysis, until the
   option was toggled or "Reset Options to Default" was used

 - Fix failure to open playback device when using macOS Catalina with
   certain audio devices

 - Remove dependency on JACK in Linux deb package: the application can
   use it if available, but it isn't required

 - Fix failure to make installed executables executable when
   installing from the source package
