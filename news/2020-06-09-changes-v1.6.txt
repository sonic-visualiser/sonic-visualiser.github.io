=== 9th June 2020 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v1.6 released

== Changes in Sonic Annotator 1.6 since the previous release 1.5:

Front-end changes:

 - Add support for reading the Opus audio codec on all platforms

 - Add support for reading WMA and AAC formats on 64-bit Windows. (AAC
   was already supported on macOS.)  Note that AAC support on Windows
   is not "gapless", i.e. the decoder provides no way to identify and
   remove the encoder gap at the start of the stream, so timings will
   vary between Windows and Mac. For this reason, like mp3, AAC should
   not be used as a file format of record

 - Add warning to the help text about avoiding mp3 and AAC as file
   format of record

Build changes:

 - General updates to dependency libraries and build system following
   changes to the rest of the Sonic Visualiser family code since v1.5
   appeared
