=== 14th August 2020 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v4.2 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser v4.2 since the previous release 4.1:

 - Speed up startup, especially on Windows and especially when a lot
   of plugins are installed. Plugins are now scanned after the main
   window has been displayed, and the Transform menus are populated
   dynamically when the results are available.

 - Fix incompatibility of 64-bit Windows build with Windows 7
