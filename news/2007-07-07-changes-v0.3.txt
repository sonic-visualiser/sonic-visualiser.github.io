=== 7th July 2007 &mdash; Sonic Annotator v0.3 released

== Changes in Sonic Annotator 0.3 since the previous release 0.2:

Front-end changes:

 - A new --force front-end option (distinct from the --csv-force and
 --rdf-force back-end options) has been added, which makes Sonic
 Annotator continue to process subsequent audio files instead of
 exiting after an error, if multiple audio files have been specified.

RDF back-end (feature writer) changes:

 - The RDF writer now conforms more correctly with the Music Ontology
 in the way it relates signal, track, and track metadata.  Signals
 that have available metadata now gain a Track resource to associate
 that metadata with, instead of hanging it directly from the Signal
 resource; also the audio file now encodes the signal rather than the
 signal being available as the audio file (matching the domain
 specification of the Music Ontology).  Note that this new resource
 structure will not be properly read by versions of Sonic Visualiser
 prior to 1.6 (should importing the data into Sonic Visualiser be of
 interest to you).

 - The --rdf-signal-uri option has been removed and replaced with the
 more meaningful set of options --rdf-audiofile-uri, --rdf-track-uri,
 and --rdf-maker-uri.

 - A new --rdf-network option is available, to cause Sonic Annotator
 to try to retrieve RDF descriptions for plugins from the network
 where those descriptions are not available locally.  Use of this
 option is recommended, but it is not the default because of the
 possible performance implication (even though the results are mostly
 cached, there may be some network access involved).

 - The RDF writer now writes the computed_by property for signal
 features.

 - Plugin and output URIs in the resulting RDF are now percent-encoded.
