=== 7th December 2018 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.2 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.2 since the previous release 3.1.1:

 - Add ability to zoom closer than one sample per pixel, so as to see
   the interpolated signal level between samples

 - Add oversampling control to the spectrogram and spectrum layers

 - Highlight and label frequency peaks in the spectrum as the mouse
   rolls over them, when enabled in the parameter area

 - Add feature to convert and import audio from a CSV data file

 - Add some new colour maps, and restore the old Blue on Black one

 - Speed up spectrum rendering at high resolutions

 - Fix failure to pass Nyquist bins correctly to
   frequency-domain-input Vamp plugins in some circumstances

 - Fix sometimes incorrect shortcut associations for new-layer menu
   items

 - Various other rendering improvements and bug fixes
