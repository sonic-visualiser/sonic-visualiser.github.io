=== 16th July 2012 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v2.0 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 2.0 since the previous release 1.9:

 - Support 64-bit builds on OS/X (using CoreAudio instead of
   obsolete QuickTime audio file reader)

 - Simplify RDF reading and fix some bugs. Now requires Dataquay
   (http://breakfastquay.com/dataquay/) rather than using Redland
   directly. Release builds use Sord/Serd rather than Redland

 - Add a fullscreen mode on the F11 key
