=== 18th June 2020 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v4.1 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser v4.1 since the previous release 4.0.1:

 - Support "dark mode" on Windows and Linux as well as macOS

 - Add right-click (or Ctrl-click, on the Mac) context menus to the
   layer property tabs, pane zoom controls, and all dial controls,
   providing some basic edit and reset functions

 - Provide format options when exporting layers to CSV, allowing
   control over column separator, header row, and timestamp format

 - Permit and handle optional header row when importing from CSV

 - Add export of spectrogram data to CSV formats

 - Support doubling escapes for quotes in quoted CSV fields on import

 - Fix truncated image export when exporting from spectrogram view
   that hasn't finished loading when the export is requested

 - Fix failure to show parameter updates when changing the current
   program in a Vamp plugin that supports programs (e.g. Melodia)

 - Fix inability of Windows builds to open https:// URLs

 - Add references to Vamp Plugin Pack in "Find a Transform" results
   for plugins that are not yet installed but are available in pack

 - Improve and tidy various aspects of OSC support, and update
   documentation for it

 - Improve performance of peak-frequency spectrogram

 - Fix missing undo/redo of layer renames

 - Fix failure to audition effects plugins live, while adjusting their
   parameters in preparation for applying them - this worked in some
   cases, but not the most common ones; it should now work everywhere
