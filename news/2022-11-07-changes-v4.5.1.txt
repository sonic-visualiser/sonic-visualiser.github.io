=== 7th November 2022 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v4.5.1 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser v4.5.1 since the previous release 4.5:

 - Update to use Rubber Band v3 with its higher quality timestretcher
   (the older, lower-CPU one is still available in preferences). This
   means the build requires rubberband-3.0.0 or newer, so you may need
   to install it separately if building on an older system.

 - Fix inability to select Hz as the unit of a layer following import

 - Provisional fix to bailing out on startup when invoked with "Open
   With..." on Mac

 - Fix nonsense display when showing frequency scaled points with value
   of 0Hz
