=== 16th June 2014 &mdash; Tony v0.6 released

== Changes in Tony 0.6 since the previous release 0.5:

 - The play pointer no longer tracks to the centre of the main pane
   when dragging, and is now always visible. Play pointer / playhead
   behaviour is generally expected to be much more sensible and
   intuitive in this release than in prior ones

 - Many keyboard shortcuts have been added and improved, including the
   shortcuts for incremental note-by-note selection and moving the
   play pointer

 - Audio files are now implicitly normalised to peak == 1.0 when
   loading

 - Tony now has an Analysis menu which contains various configuration
   settings that affect pitch analysis

 - There is now an option to save the session directly to the same
   directory as the original audio file, for rapid saving when
   annotating many audio files in sequence

 - The extents of the "active" note are now more clearly shown when
   mousing over the note track

 - There is a new function to delete the notes (without deleting pitch
   measurements) within the selection

 - Numerous bug fixes
