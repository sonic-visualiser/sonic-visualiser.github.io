=== 1st September 2014 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v2.4 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 2.4 since the previous release 2.3:

 - Add support for left/right scrolling using a two-finger touchpad
   gesture (where available)

 - Make the octave numbering into a configurable option, and change
   the default. Previously Sonic Visualiser labelled middle-C as "C3";
   now it labels middle-C as "C4", a more common standard in the world
   outside MIDI sequencer software. The previous system is available
   as an option in the Preferences. This affects only the visible
   labels: there is no change to analysis or to the file format

 - Sonify time-value layers. Any time-value curve whose scale unit is
   set to Hz will now acquire a playback toggle control; this control
   is off by default, but if it is switched on, the curve will be
   played back using a variable-frequency sound generator

 - Add support for playback of note layers with non-MIDI frequencies
   (formerly the note playback was limited to exact MIDI pitch)

 - Change the default playback sample for note layers from piano to an
   electric piano with sustain. The piano sample is still available,
   and any sessions saved using it should continue to use it

 - Add a cancel button for Vamp plugin processing: currently,
   cancelling a transform results in a part-complete layer rather than
   removing the results

 - Add keyboard shortcuts to cycle the current layer (in addition to
   the existing ones to cycle the current pane)

 - Fix various bugs related to layer ordering: layer tabs re-ordering
   themselves randomly when new layer added, layers being ordered
   randomly when saving and reloading a session

 - Fix incorrect interaction with non-Unicode usernames when creating
   temporary and template directories on Windows

 - Shade the start and end of the main audio file, to make them easier
   to see for files that start or end in silence

 - Speed up rendering and scrolling in time-value layers

 - Make it possible to import CSV files directly into Note layers by
   adding Pitch as a data type in the CSV file import dialog

 - Fix play pointer jump to wrong frame when clicking on row in the
   layer edit dialog

 - Fix problems with keyboard shortcuts when using Qt5 on OS/X. This
   is the first release in which the official builds use Qt5 for all
   platforms.
