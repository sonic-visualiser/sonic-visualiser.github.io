=== 14th July 2018 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v3.1 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 3.1 since the previous release 3.0.3:

 - Add Plugins tab to Preferences dialog, from which you can review
   the plugin load paths and see which plugins were loaded from which
   locations, and also customise load paths (though the various path
   environment variables are still supported)

 - Stream the export of audio data and other CSV data so that
   very large exports don't hang the UI or run us out of memory
   (thanks to Lucas Thompson)

 - Ensure vertical scale appears for auto-align layers when there is
   nothing else to auto-align them to

 - Fix another long-standing Windows-platform wide-char/utf8
   conversion problem, with environment variable naming and contents

 - Improve handling of incomplete session loads, i.e. situations where
   the audio files referred to by a session could not be found -
   previously the session could be re-saved immediately thus losing
   the audio reference; now at least we disable Save (enabling only
   Save As) and show a warning

 - Update pane and layer menu shortcuts so that the
   waveform/spectrogram/etc shortcuts (Shift+G etc) operate on the
   source model in the currently-selected pane rather than the main
   model. This is a backward-incompatible change but is a far more
   intuitive way for the function to work

 - Use dark background for bright colours in time-value/note/etc
   layers as well as e.g. waveforms - this is how it was always
   "intended to" work, but it is a backward-incompatible change

 - Make "Select All" select the whole span of everything that exists,
   not just the main model

 - Add horizontal scale to Spectrum layer

 - Improve spacing and labelling of vertical log scales

 - Update build system for better Cap'n Proto version support and to
   use Repoint for code management in the repository

 - Various other bug fixes
