=== 5th December 2008 &mdash; Sonic Visualiser v1.4 released

== Changes in Sonic Visualiser 1.4 since the previous release 1.3:

 - SV now has a Region layer type, used for display of features with
 durations.  It also supports Vamp v2.0 plugins that provide durations
 for features.

 - Layer data can now be imported from RDF described using the Audio
 Features Ontology, as well as from the existing text file types.  SV
 can also export annotation layer data to RDF/Turtle, although in a
 somewhat simplistic manner at present.

 - You can search for transforms by text in the new "Find a Transform"
 dialog.  This searches both installed plugins, and plugins that have
 not been installed but that have descriptions available on the
 semantic web.

 - You can now zoom and scroll vertically in the time-value, note,
 and colour 3d plot layers.

 - Sonic Visualiser can now load sessions from uncompressed XML files
 as well as its own compressed-XML .sv format.  Files with extension
 .xml that contain suitable session data will be loaded as sessions.
 Note that .xml extension files still do not show up in the default
 file load filter.  This is intentional, as there may be any kind of
 data in them -- if you want to load uncompressed session files from
 XML, you need to know you're doing it.

 - Several crashes and other bugs have been fixed.
